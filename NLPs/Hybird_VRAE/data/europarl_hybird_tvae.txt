i onli want to ...
you are the right man for the job .
you can keep quiet , lad .
it is you .
i onli want to be sure .
we are in parliament , lad .
you can continu it later .
( the order of busi wa adopt )
one-minut speech on matter of polit import
you will , of cours , receiv an answer on this point .
the various countri held veri differ opinion on this issu .
wine , wheat , peac !
mr presid , i rise on the issu of palestin .
you exceed your speak time by 50 % .
the debat will take place on wednesday afternoon .
thank you mr presid .
two of our fellow member have alreadi spoken of this .
mr presid , nowaday we are face with a paradox .
this is obvious ridicul and outrag .
i trust the lithuanian author will reflect on the matter .
howev , now to the matter in hand .
the austrian polic stop a truck containing137 puppi .
the journey start in slovakia and wa due to end in spain .
but is it realli ?
this is a bloodi pre-elect campaign .
- ( c ) happi new year , mr presid .
it ha even postpon negoti with russia over energi secur .
i am yet more shock by the posit of the european commiss .
or perhap this wa just a bad new year 's joke ?
madam presid , i wish to rais the issu of zimbabw .
you must insist that israel stop the kill .
we have to demand an end to the attack on gaza .
- ( c ) thank you , madam presid .
such a fight would be both futil and ridicul .
take the issu of the plant protect product .
we have abandon the scientif principl of risk ass .
it is becom unprofit to collect such materi .
recycl paper ha been much in the news recent .
this item is close .
the next item is the joint debat on the follow report :
we have not made it easi for ourselv .
plant protect product are , in fact , medicin for plant .
risk reduct is the primari object .
we have reach a good compromis .
this should be rectifi .
nobodi can quantifi the risk .
therefor , safeti can onli be achiev with an outright ban .
they would dilut this compromis .
duplic test on anim would be complet avoid .
the commiss ha just made a declar on this point .
neurotox substanc , for exampl .
i think that we should have been more ambiti .
this is a victori for health and for the environ .
until now there ha been no definit of these .
no legisl text dealt with this question .
this compromis take account of their fear .
there is also the possibl of derog .
there is no doubt that rate of cancer have increas .
we can not and should not legisl in the abstract .
ireland ha a uniqu temper but wet climat .
in theori this may work .
in practic we need to make this work .
we have a preced .
you should read the agreement !
your amend will bring about exact the opposit situat .
plea look at it again .
this is the crux of the matter and noth el .
and now to mr klass , mani thank for your work !
we should , in fact , be concern with general interest .
this chiefli concern high-risk substanc .
it is difficult to strike a balanc between good and bad .
what is import are the option , not quantiti .
and you seem to have ignor the benefit of crop rotat .
a ever , a compromis is about give and take .
the fertil of this land is great diminish .
sustain use of pesticid is an import issu .
this propos avoid unnecessari bureaucraci .
our rapporteur is on the right track .
this report propos strict and tighter control .
that is what is propos .
i do , in fact , have reserv about that .
i do not believ that that will happen .
peopl will then choos to buy such a product in particular .
there would be a risk there of unfair competit .
wors is better !
let me tell you now .
it is ici out there - that is a hazard .
there is a risk i will fall over when i walk home .
you can legisl for neither of them .
it will damag food product .
it will put farmer out of busi .
it will make food price higher , particular in the uk .
except are allow where no altern are yet avail .
that , too , is import .
who is give thought to the current public health problem ?
this will be a credit to parliament .
i come from a veri wet countri .
my farmer struggl continu with fungal infest .
fungi - unlik insect that come and go - come and stay .
we are told pesticid might disrupt dna .
gm is base on disrupt dna .
this wa also reflect in the deliber in parliament .
howev , substanc that are realli hazard will also be ban .
this is wonder success for consum and farmer .
thank you veri much .
i believ that the compromis we hope to agre on are sound .
our farmer will have to pay more for safer pesticid .
therefor , we can live with the compromis .
forest can not be maintain without aerial spray .
in my low-li countri , the situat is veri specif .
we can endors the propos .
we face two particular import problem .
for this reason , this direct pose extrem serious danger .
the commiss doe not have the answer to that question .
will the derog work ?
what happen if there are no altern ?
we have done a huge amount of survey on this .
i leav you with one or two last thought on this .
i would rather that it were stipul that they must do this .
we realli do urg you to have a proper impact ass .
may i take it is a ppe-d time ?
my pleasur !
alcohol , pure alcohol , is a hazard .
if you drink pure alcohol , we know what happen .
may i say that these are two differ issu .
the eu impact ass ha been refer to .
now we have these propos on pesticid .
probabl not !
i am also plea with the compromis reach on aerial spray .
but what have we done along the way ?
what will be left then , on averag ?
littl to noth !
we do not need to damag product in the process .
the principl of prevent must be appli .
this is the posit regard import good .
what wa achiev is import .
we still need an evalu .
a rapporteur , i thank you for your support .
i would like more posit think for the new year .
europ is now in the fast lane .
europ is show that it is the world 's trailblaz .
therefor , plea stop creat this fear and dissens .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
- mr mcguin , you have a point of order .
farmer in europ will be ban from use particular substanc .
we will not find residu in the food that come in .
we are talk about a competit disadvantag for eu produc .
sorri for the anger .
- the joint debat is close .
we are not go to re-open the debat .
mr breyer ha the floor .
but i will state again that the problem is solv .
full stop .
- we are not go to re-open the debat .
written statement ( rule 142 )
they could have been includ among the non-chem method .

this version is consid therefor to offer suffici guarante .
action plan on urban mobil ( debat )
let me go straight to the point .
but what can be done concret at eu level ?
let u take this step , keep this promis !
are some member state oppos to this plan ?
my good , i hope not !
commission , we are a few week away from the elect .
time is run out .
in my opinion this is the basic approach .
these statist were also cite by mr vassiliou .
the cohes fund may also support this work .
it is high time for unequivoc decis .
i am veri disappoint with your respons .
in all our citi , we face problem of mobil .
what respons can we give to europ 's citizen ?
- the debat is close .
written statement ( rule 142 )
road safeti would also be improv .
i am vehement oppos to the commiss 's plan .
this would give commerci channel consider input .
is that what we want ?
a market test will inevit increas the level of paperwork .
should the broadcast corpor foot the bill ?
or the taxpay , perhap ?
this initi is not workabl in small member state .
there are also differ in term of languag and cultur .
this wa an excel result .
i should like to ask the commiss a few more question .
second , how can technolog imparti be guarante ?
we are serious about the process of wide consult .
this dialogu between the commiss and parliament is import .
we stand readi to listen and to repli to your question .
whi do we have these test ?
second , the draft exempt pilot project from the test .
well , to some extent , this is true , but not entir .
my main object is that it clash with the lisbon strategi .
do not get u wrong , though .
this financi balanc , therefor , must be protect .
we requir this a part of the lisbon strategi .
i should also like to say a few word about the red tape .
so , just a in europ , the two are intertwin .
we monitor the adapt to technolog chang .
we monitor the measur in order to ensur fair competit .
our independ is guarante by law .
we are in turn complet and right control by the public .
this is how an effect medium polici work .
out of the mani problem i will mention three .
let me comment on some of your remark .
the commiss agre with these goal .
this is clear state in the amsterdam protocol .
this will also remain the case for the futur .

written statement ( rule 142 )
i would like to draw your attent to three aspect :
it can be done .
it take public polici initi to do it .
how do we do that ?
i give a warn .
well over a year ago we were talk about high commod price .

a sustain eu biofuel polici is overal a pro-poor polici .
enhanc trade flow are part of the solut toward food secur .
the debat is close .
the vote will take place on tuesday at 12 noon .
written statement ( rule 142 )
integr and effect polici are need , such a :
a global food and food reserv inventori ;
the fact is , 860 million peopl continu to starv .
we must therefor protect it at all cost !
the agricultur sector need to improv it energi effici .
these contact are inadequ .
more is requir , howev .
that is whi i refer to civil dialogu in this report .
the latter is a dialogu that is not defin in law .
it is not easi to establish rule govern this area .
these would becom common principl for all the institut .
i have been unabl to mention everi part of this report .
the debat is close .
the vote will take place on tuesday at 12 noon .
written statement ( rule 142 )
a fundament question therefor aris .
what is this debat actual all about ?
after all , the treati of lisbon is dead .
ireland reject it in a nation referendum .
build anyth on it is like build on sand , without foundat .
this all bring to mind the definit of democraci .
is that so difficult to understand ?

i would just like to conclud with two final comment .
howev , it is not onli about be competit .
we have come a long way sinc juli 2008 .
the commiss can now sign up to the compromis text .
our work in this is , howev , not finish .
first , regard the issu of taxat of cross-bord merger .
the green paper led to a public debat .
in 2005 it wa follow by a white paper .
it is a complet passport and we welcom it .
my sceptic give way to concern .
it may be that fundament question need to be ask .
it is mark by a certain nonchal .
this ha larg happen .
mani obstacl were remov in 2001 .
it wa also prior to the lamfalussi process .
there will be an improv in market .
there will be greater protect for investor .
we have alreadi heard comment on this .
we are awar of the differ opinion .
howev , i think that the present propos is a good one .
competit and open are alway good in a well-organis market .
a balanc must be achiev between relev inform and effect .
too much inform is not good but neither is too littl .
a reason balanc is also requir in this area .
they describ it at the time a a backward step .
this must onli be in the interest of the investor .
the second observ relat to the issu of retent .
my third observ relat to the issu of supervis .
we thus need the supervis issu in this area to be defin .
final , my last observ is about tax regim issu .
we should also avoid creat legal uncertainti .
it is a result of a remark quick consensus .
that is crucial .
thank you veri much .
the debat is close .
the vote will take place short .
( the sit wa suspend at 09.40 and resum at 10.00 . )
formal sit and debat - 10th anniversari of the euro
it introduct requir courag and decis .
the euro area ha becom a rock of macroeconom stabil .
a veri warm welcom , mr giscard d'esta .
( applaus )
( applaus )
without them , there would be no euro .
this price stabil is an advantag for all european citizen .
( applaus )
this is a time for celebr and , a i said , i am veri move .
but this is no time for complac .
current challeng are press and new challeng will aris .
i would like to mention three of them .
first , the financi crisi .
second , monetari union .
third , enlarg .
when we start out 10 year ago , we were 11 countri .
we are now 16 countri .
this say a lot about our histor endeavour .
the euro is an histor achiev .
what matter most today is our respons for the futur .
new challeng are aris .
the journey ha not been without it difficulti and shock .
except situat demand except measur .
the crisi is , without a doubt , a touchston for the euro .
we must safeguard the foundat of this success .
today we must say a big thank you ' to all of them .
what fine word can we use in our anniversari toast ?
we also respect their determin and independ .
i would like to finish with two remark .
that success today goe by the love name of the euro .
( applaus )
some govern are loath to provid europ with symbol .
of cours , we are not all use the euro .
there were 11 of u to start with , and now there are 16 .
we are expect other to join u .
i think that this is the best proof of our success .
it is not a normal situat .
let u learn then the lesson from this .
this is whi it is a major issu for this parliament .
the euro ha been well-receiv by the public .
it ha gain the world 's trust .
that is someth we can all be proud of .
thank you .
( applaus )
in 10 year , the euro ha becom a strong symbol for europ .
for those who do not , the euro wa associ with price rise .
today , the crisi ha chang mani of these percept .
it particular pertin decis have been welcom unanim .
they are the guarante of effect , compet and growth .
in ani case , the attract of the euro remain intact .
follow slovenia , slovakia ha just join u .
the euro will have a key role to play in this new stabil .
the ecb is onli in charg of monetari polici .
today , the fact tell a rather differ stori .
it ha a huge import role to play here .
quit the revers : we must ensur that it remain valid .
the euro 's intern role need to be further strengthen .
this is no mere bagatell .
he did not persuad u .
this is the veri problem which we are face today .
whi were we against the euro at that time ?
there were basic two reason for it .
three major chang have taken place .
this target may seem a bit absurd .
what remain to be done then ?
the task of set the exchang rate is assign to the council .
we must find the proper instrument to do this .
it is all delusion stuff .
the idea that the ecb ha done a good job is extraordinari .
the euro zone ha never been test but it is about to be .
spain is in econom troubl .
but the greek govern is stuck insid the euro straitjacket .
there is noth it can do .
we have been abl to do the thing that we need to do .
you can go on buri your head in the sand if you want .
the imbal long predict by sceptic are start to bite .
itali 's competit is shot to piec .
the market are specul on a euro break-up .
happi birthday to the euro !
the debat is close .

that is inde what happen .
the market regul itself .
unfortun , we have awoken too late .
we welcom the commiss 's european econom recoveri plan .
i shall spend a littl more time on national-level solut .
the global financi crisi ha also hit latvia .
latvia is grate for this express of solidar .
each of these state is follow it own path of develop .
the financi and econom crisi is cyclic in it own way .
they are becom more and more urgent .

explan of vote ( continu )
madam presid , i also support this vote .
this is not in disput .
madam presid , i have a confess to make .
i agre with the aim of this report .
i think we need impact ass conduct on a scientif basi .
i share their concern .
we need an explan of that in order to bring farmer with u .
let u make sure that doe not happen again .
that is whi i vote to undermin the compromis .
in my experi this is the opposit of the truth .
similar , farmer have also been the basi of our health .
written explan of vote
link to this discus is that relat to secur .
just like the issu of safeti one can never be too secur .
we are live in a new era .
criterion must be found to which both parti must adher .
serbia , for exampl , is not even mention .
all these import aspect are reflect in the report .
a realist perspect of membership can also prevent this .
the current popul growth rate is over 70 million per year .
howev , there are also aspect with which we can not agre :
that is whi we abstain .
i have therefor vote against this report .
i vote against this report .
for these reason , i support m grabowska 's report .
that is whi we have vote against .
how would this mindset be defin ?
i have therefor vote against this report .
this is bind on all eu polici and sphere of activ .
i therefor vote against this report .
other countri dare not even organis a referendum .
the revers is true !
at ani rate , i emphat vote against this report again .
nec spe , nec metu or without hope or fear .
anyon may contribut to the common good .
access to the dialogu must be equit .
this dialogu is difficult but also a necess .
the post-christma sale provid an excel opportun for check .
i vote in favour of this report .
such a polici is not a foregon conclus .
there are altern polici for the fish industri in portug .
in write . - i vote in favour of mr guerreiro 's report .
that is whi we vote in favour of the compromis .
the debat wa a heat one within our group too .
it must therefor immedi includ altern solut .
pesticid are unavoid in modern farm .
a linear reduct in the number of product would be insan .
a follow-up ass here is indispens .
the problem with franc must be solv with understand .
i still regret the fact that we drop the 50 % object .
this , too , is now be left to the member state .
undoubt , busi will shed job and even ceas trade altogeth .
undoubt , agricultur yield will go down .
it is over prescript and lack flexibl .
for these reason i vote against this propos .
the chine toy episod should be a lesson to u .
there ha been no impact ass of the propos ;
derog option were expressli creat for 12 substanc .
we also had our reserv with regard to the zonal approach .
it is a veri difficult vote .
farmer are most affect due to direct contact .
we can not vote in favour of this legisl .
we can not legisl in the abstract !
hiltrud breyer 's report is on the right line .
that is whi we have vote against .
correct to vote and vote intent : see minut
approv of the minut of the previous sit : see minut
contrari to the procedur in 2004 , we are now in codecis .

in fact , this mean the staff at the local post offic .
that is not yet the case .
that wa decid in 2004 .
the principl is that of one person-on passport ' .
we vote against biometr in visa .
we are also against biometr in european passport .
it is therefor right to creat an exempt here for child .
of cours , this will carri a price tag .
commission , our child 's safeti demand our perman attent .
today we are take one particular step .
so today parliament ha achiev a balanc .
i wish to comment on just one point in the report .
in short , we should be reason flexibl in this regard .
how would that be monitor ?
thank you veri much .
i think the report is not onli import , but also good .
that balanc ha , i think , been found in this report .
mr presid , i also wish to thank mr coelho .
we have check and balanc , but we can do better .
the new method of identif will simplifi border control .
i would like to highlight three import aspect .
i just want to rais a point for futur refer .
this stay the same from concept to death and even beyond .
we should not even be discus that .
it is the duti of a constitut state to control that .
that is whi this meet ha been schedul .
i will give the parliament sever answer to sever question .
thank you veri much to all of you for your collabor .
the debat is close .
written statement ( rule 142 )
in estonia it ha been in forc sinc 2000 .
there will , howev , be an absolut age limit of six year .
the first is about the council .
we are entitl to know who is vote in the council and how .
this is a veri import point !
we are commit to continu to enhanc transpar and open .
i think the discus should not end there .
so let u do that .
you were the one who introduc 18 amend to your own report .
commission wallström ha just said someth similar .
some of your suggest are therefor imposs .
second , some of your suggest are inadvis .
this would not do .
i can not , therefor , agre with you on this point .
some of your other assert , mr cappato , are incorrect .
this is a bold exagger , mr cappato .
it can alreadi be seen , mr cappato .
the allow that mep claim are also public .
thank you for your generos , mr presid .
the previous speaker said that it is imposs .
but of cours you have gone beyond your remit .
we are not go to have broadcast of polit group .
that is what we need to get back to .
we need to defin what the legisl capac ' is .
we all want to take the whole issu of access forward .
that is whi draw up the vote list will be difficult .
my heart is with you , but i have to follow my head .
otherwis , parti confer would not be broadcast so extens .
thank you veri much for the extra time , mr presid .
good luck , marco .
howev , these debat do not includ polit group debat .
the rapporteur might want to bear this in mind .
i also support the amend tabl by the rapporteur .
i support the propos for a combin public regist .
in democrat countri , the citizen elect the govern author .
these author appoint offici to implement democrat decis .
the fact that this happen nevertheless ha two explan .
the first explan is complet irrelev today .
the eu doe not have a proud tradit of transpar .
there is a lot of intern resist to quash .
i applaud mr cappato 's initi .
i will vote for near everyth contain in his propos .
negoti lead to the most accept decis for all concern .
the e-parlia is a veri welcom initi .
this is our rout now and in the futur .
i support the cappato report .
it is import that we are debat it here in parliament .
i agre with much of the report .
i have one or two caveat .
by this i mean that our workload is realli quit broad .
it is not just attend at committe or plenari .
this is crucial .
then i did what so mani citizen do .
i want to know someth , and that wa : how are decis made ?
where doe the money go ?
who receiv it ?
this wa also my experi .
that would be an achiev , and i say this after 10 year .
mr alvaro is absolut right in this regard .
this is , of cours , imposs .
our parliament must set an exampl for the other institut .
mr presid , i note care what the rapporteur said .
i have no fear of transpar .
i welcom this initi .
i think we are still struggl with that in some case .
you can also improv and add to open and transpar .
this is certain a part of strengthen democraci in europ .
that would be one of the ultim test for all of u .
that is not true .
i person have been a direct victim of this .
mr presid , thank you for your understand .
the debat is close .

so far , this conflict ha claim 1 000 live in 17 day .
it is actual a shame that we are have to discus this .
( applaus from the left )
a fundament adjust is need , therefor .
there will have to be dialogu with hama .
what is need is an immedi ceasefir .
at that time , the main terrorist wa yasser arafat .
what wa possibl then can be possibl also in futur .
( applaus from the left )
i should like to make two addit point .
( applaus )
well , the aim of this war is more secur for israel .
and that is whi we have to be veri clear here .
the palestinian need to be protect from hama .
palestinian civilian need to be protect from hama .
that is our task .
it is not easi , but we must be clear .
this is a poor solut ; this is not the right solut !
( applaus )
that is one of the truth that hama must also be told .
hama must be told this , too .
( applaus )
rahe is in despair , and is in the centr that we visit .
we are ineffectu .
bring in a cease-fir !
bring in a cease-fir !
a cease-fir is what we want !
this is extrem import .
i think it is import , and that it is a strong messag .
you were speak about protect and intern protect .
( applaus )
mani thank , mr morgantini .
this seem to me to be the sensibl start point .
at the same time , the isra attack must be stop .
there is one final comment i should like to make .
this is just a small first step .
this must be the start point of a new isra polici .
the border must be control , and the blockad must be lift .
i should like to express my firm convict befor i conclud .
it is not the war that must be won today , but peac .
( applaus )
two or three hundr ; and how mani isra civilian ?
could the intern communiti have done more ?
in my opinion , the answer is yes .
it ought to have done more .
we should feel the full weight of our respons .
mr presid , i realli am finish .
protect the civilian popul - this is the real emerg .
the answer is most certain no ' .
this wa a tragic mistak !
( applaus )
the un secur council ha adopt a resolut .
there should be respect for intern law .
no impun should be permit ani longer .
there should be a full intern investig .
let unwra carri out it mission .
the eu ha taken step , but onli at a humanitarian level .
it ha to show decis at the polit level .
use the claus in the associ agreement .
stop the upgrad of relat with israel .
stop arm export to israel .
there can onli be a polit solut to this conflict .
to save futur generat , we need to stop the war now .
here , a elsewher , multicultur ha it limit .
where there are two peopl , there must be two state .
so , it is time to get down to work !
mr presid , i abhor terror .
i repudi the propaganda of terror .
the situat is demonstr clear .
israel accept a two-stat solut .
stop shell israel .
so what are our next move ?
they are not new .
by take this posit , we help to destroy this joint govern .
we need dialogu !
whi are they vote for hama ?
that is the onli real requir .
( applaus )
they break your heart . '
this is not a proportion respons of a civilis power .
it is evil .
it is evil .
yes , the hama rocket must stop .
we have some respons for israel 's action .
we do not plan to condemn israel : we intend to reward it .
in order to do this , the violenc must be end immedi .
we also went to egypt .
howev , the resolut also rais issu about our own liabil .
this wa complic by anticip .
today i hear : it is necessari to talk to hama ' .
mr presid , what is happen in gaza is heartbreak .
there is no excus ; there is no possibl justif .
in 2007 the valu of eu-israel trade wa eur 25.7 billion .
we must also call for the immedi applic of the un resolut .
this suggest a radic chang in the natur of the conflict .
last , israel is not a special case .
( applaus )
it is despair that grip u today ; this war is a tragedi .
the question answer itself .
mr ferrero-waldn ha made this point .
( applaus )
howev , the inhabit of gaza are not just innoc victim .
anyon who elect crimin must logic share their fate .
there wa no hypocrit umbrag .
the german freeli elect hitler and share in his fate .
the gazan also knew who they were elect and whi .
proport inde !
i strong object to anyon tri to demonis a nation .
the conflict we are discus today is an asymmetr conflict .
today we are condemn israel .
it ha someth to condemn , it ha author .
there is a govern that can be condemn and censur .
would that be proport ?
he ha until 5.20 p.m. at the latest , i have been told .
be a general , mr morillon will set a good exampl .
is this riski solut accept , today , to israel ?
but is there ani other solut ?
if there is , tell me .
the core respons doe not fade away .
let u be more courag in this strategi .
there is no other way .
ani kind of peac is better than bloodi conflict .
yet we have provid no ad valu .
what is the council do at this time ?
the road to last peac lead onli through polit negoti .
nobodi care about them .
how about those on the ground ?
what can we do ?
make call and resolut doe not help the civilian .
how can we pas from word to deed ?
israel is bomb and decim a ghetto .
the son of those who were extermin have becom extermin .
i believ that we need to tackl the situat proper .
i believ that the real loser are all of u .
it ha provid money and train for hama fighter .
this must stop .
it should be implement without delay .
this is an issu of respect for intern humanitarian law .
it is an issu of proport .
so they should .
our pain is at the enorm suffer of so mani victim .
the intern communiti took littl notic .
we need a marshal plan for the middl east .
i have not , to date , oppos the new eu-israel agreement .
i do not think it is yet time to do so .
i have seen it in africa .
i have seen it in ireland .
i have seen it in mani place .
that happen .
i think we should be adam about that .
i know how difficult the question is .
we are in contact with the egyptian the whole time .
there wa a question on how we can assist in the region .
it is not for u to decid what we should give them .
they have to ask u and the european union .
that is the first task to be carri out .
i think it is a veri good idea and we should follow it .
m ferrero-waldn and other mention what the mission achiev .
there wa a discus about upgrad our relat with israel .
what can be done to stop israel ?
let u be frank - veri littl .
i think it polit are also harm israel .
the european union can help there .
israel ha mighti alli outsid of europ too .
there are limit on our power to achiev someth .
in that respect , we have achiev quit a lot .
but do not overst our possibl .
clear , the eu alon can not resolv this .
but there is a white eleph in the room .
we need the resolv of the usa .
their disappoint respons ha been imbalanc and unjust .
the world is wait and the eu is a will partner !
will you work with u to provid protect for all concern ?
this is not the way to help israel or palestinian .
an immedi ceasefir is onli a necessari start .
the forc use must be proport to the wrong endur .
i think this is quintessenti , and everyon agre to this .
it is unfortun that the un 's resolut ha been sidelin .
it is also regrett that the eu still need to find a role .
we have leverag .
so we are abl to exercis that role .
we can do a lot and we must .
mr presid , i wa elect to this hous 25 year ago .
( da ) mr presid , i just want to say two thing .
what actual happen ?
it simpli went and increas the rate of settlement .
intern opinion is against the continu of this war .
it is time to end this unfortun war .
isra troop should return to their barrack .
hama ha to stop fire rocket at israel .
we are wait here .
ha it been delet from the agenda ?
that is the next item on the agenda .
of cours , we can pin all our hope on our commission .
but the death toll is rise .
speak to hama is difficult .
there is movement in ani case .
hope thing will go forward .
at least , this is what we all want .
this is what we will do .
the debat is close .
written statement ( rule 142 )
urgent humanitarian assist to the palestinian popul !
israel can not continu with impun !
negoti with hama a it is are not possibl .
sad , these shock number will increas .
i deplor that innoc civilian are use a human shield .
this ha to stop .
would that human could onli see the futil of such war .
the eye-clos are also the one arm the killer of civilian .
what will it take to have peac ?
we need cooper between major and minor on an equal foot .
un facil have been attack .
gas suppli by russia to ukrain and the eu ( debat )
the mission went to kiev .
the disput is not over yet , a we all know .
energi secur is one of the top presid prioriti .
i stop here .
where are we today ?
at the same time , i do not take side .
i do not want to blame one or the other parti .
( applaus )
well , unfortun this wa not the case .
but do they want a solut ?
we have done our part .
i believ that the measur that we have taken are suffici .
this is the immedi crisi .
what next ?
one is the lack of interconnect .
second , what pressur instrument doe the eu posse ?
what action could we take in respons ?
this must have the appropri consequ .
in my eye , 18 decemb wa perhap a littl too late .
i agre with much that ha been said here .
we need mani more interconnector and interconnect .
yet these , too , will not just appear .
the same is true of the gas reserv , of cours .
we have to make common caus in this regard .
enough of this !
this polici ha fail .
is it abl to defend it interest effect ?
there is now a need and a use for such peopl .
and , unfortun , it is be paid by the weakest .
it is the price of our fanat reject of nuclear energi .
we need to take action to safeguard secur of suppli .
there are huge save to be achiev .
what ha unfold in recent week ha led to great surpris .
i should not think so .
littl ha been done about this in recent year .
this situat doe throw up a number of question , of cours .
howev , we do not know the fact of the situat .
the eu observ are helpless .
all we know is that we are deal with frivol organis .
the use of coal is oppos under environment pretenc .
to put it briefli , two parti - two truth , no gas .
the action of russia and ukrain are irrespons .
how mani time ha russia attract attent in this regard ?
it is certain not the first time .
i think that mr swoboda wa right to ask this question .
the answer is far too littl , far too timid .
what have we done to get other permiss pipelin sort out ?
what have we done in the field of lng ?
what ha been done in the field of extern energi polici ?
that is clear the crucial question .
the russian and ukrainian deleg should also be present .
it is a serious situat , a ha been said .
million of peopl are freez and factori are be shut .
russia did the same when it cut off the eu gas section .
gas is flow , howev , through other transit countri .
a peculiar situat ha come about .
it is work for those in the pipelin industri .
a neutral parti also ought to be involv .
- thank you veri much for this final point .
nevertheless , mani peopl are freez in their own home .
whi is the eu unabl to guarante heat ?
this requir solidar within the union .
franc and germani are in a key posit .
nord stream is no solut .
we must take advantag of this opportun .
thank you .
( bg ) thank you , mr presid .
howev , let u now look at what we could do in the futur .
in this war we are not hostag but combat .
this war extend it consequ from one crisi to anoth .
could we ceas the combat and organis a peac confer ?
sanction can not work .
confront is not the solut either .
let u be unit and negoti strateg and comprehens .
it is time for action .
this wa someth offici did not forese .
( bg ) thank you , mr presid .
europ 's citizen are be held hostag .
the gas is suppli from russia .
the valv ha been turn off in russia .
this is repeat constant .
it seem that this doe not exist for our partner .
one other thing on energi solidar .
this would be true energi solidar .
this impli much improv and extend grid and pipelin .
these gap in the gas grid must be close , urgent .
what is the time for this , commission piebalg ?
we can not toler inact ani longer .
who will compens the individu citizen affect ?
what can we do now ?
let u intensifi our diplomat effort .
it is now time for action .
we have to interconnect the gas network within the eu .
ukrain is clear in the middl .
at least that wa how it look .
his polit tone is too calm .
i wonder whi it is so .
both are respons !
the fact is , if they use le , we are like to get more .
( hu ) madam presid , i suggest that we speak clear .
madam presid , i am glad to see mr vondra back .
what have you in the council done ?
you have to chang your posit on this line .
will you do so ?
i think we are quit success in do that for the time be .
you mention the intern energi packag .
this is the debat about a third-countri claus etc .
you need the right kind of a geolog environ .
that is , at least , my own view .
so it is difficult - what can we do ?
i think a courag person is one is will to take a risk .
whi not buy gas on the ukrainian-russian border ?
an excel exampl !
so we need to step up the pressur .
i think this is import on both side .
we need your help and your attent .
we have one problem and that is , of cours , the treati .
in the treati there is no common extern secur polici .
second , for two year we have had energi diplomaci .
quit a number of memoranda have been sign .
it is veri difficult to get all the actor togeth at onc .
this is my second point .
i think this is a high time event .
in realiti we are underestim what realli happen .
it wa never in my expect : it wa a shock for me too .
but it wa never to be expect .
the debat is close .
written statement ( rule 142 )
it is not clear who is to blame .
in fact , acceler the nabucco project is vital .
we must learn from the present crisi .
one of the glare shortcom come from the eu presid .
in write . - anoth wake-up call .
a for oil stock we should develop gas storag .
madam presid , commission , ladi and gentleman .
the truth is import , but it will not deliv gas .
will nabucco be built ?
will we increas our mandatori fuel reserv ?
will the ideolog oppon of atom energi chang their view ?
let u hope so .
we do not need slogan .
we need invest in infrastructur .
but the debat is veri import , albeit inadequ .
this is whi urgent action is need .
the consequ of this crisi are humanitarian and econom .
here and now .
we need a new action mechan and set of tool .
we must start build the nabucco gas pipelin without delay .
in write . - ( et ) madam presid , honour chairman .
everyth ha a posit side too , howev .
i ask : whi should not it ?
this need to be made quit clear !
wa it abl to help them at all ?
if not , there is someth wrong with integr .
who will be respons for this ?
the countri that is be fought over now is ukrain .
we hope that the packag will be adopt at second read .
we need a common extern polici in the energi sector .

we are current see the problem of energi depend .
but it is not up to u to bring a legisl propos .
here is the question on the cap .
subject : futur of the common agricultur polici 2013-2020
( ro ) unfortun , the econom crisi is lead to job loss .
purchas power is decreas .
qualiti of life also mean , howev , healthi food .
so we have farmer with hugo bos tie now .
we did not have this five to ten year ago .
this is the onli way to keep europ competit .
so we have here a complex problem .
and mr ţicău 's question ?
that conclud question time .

situat in the horn of africa ( debat )
i know that parliament also keep abreast of develop .
there are sever sourc of tension in the horn of africa .
i will get to them in more detail .
what are these link between conflict ?
there are also serious region interdepend .
let me mention some of them .
food secur is anoth interdepend .
this is of cours a major concern in the region .
so what are the action which the european union undertak ?
what is our engag or involv ?
this particular concern matter of govern and human right .
those are the main issu .
first , let me say a word on ethiopia/eritrea .
we will continu to support such process .
inde , 2009 is a decis year for the futur of this countri .
in somalia , the peac process is in a crucial phase .
there is no plan b for the djibouti process .
the import of this region transcend pure geograph bound .
what we expect is a minimum accept of univers valu .
human right , democraci and good govern are empti word .
i will describ two recent episod ...
each war , each conflict accentu the fragil of the state .
this forc need a decent un mandat .
i entir agre with commission ferrero-waldn .
the power a well a the secur vacuum must be fill .
if not , the stateless chao known a somalia will remain .
the unit nation put this figur at over twelv million .
his crime is state a have report independ news ' .
this should increas the pressur on eritrea .
the time for silent diplomaci is past .
enough is enough .
this is a power step in the right direct .
no trial , and what wa their crime ?
now it is time to act .
human right are abus a a matter of cours .
civil societi is weak .
alarm , the situat could easili deterior further .
past experi suggest this would be a terribl mistak .
she wa re-arrest at the end of the year .
then i would like to make five short conclud remark .
atalanta is a short-term measur to curb piraci .
howev , it wa a necessari short-term measur .
we are veri concern about these tremend challeng .
the debat is close .
the vote will take place on thursday , 15 januari 2009 .
eu strategi toward belarus ( debat )
let me start here on a posit note .
the particip of belarus will depend on it domest develop .
we have seen some progress in the last three month .
progress is , howev , a two-way street .
this , howev , will not be a one-way street .
that is an old english say .
the ball , a they say , is in minsk 's court .
the commission ha mention this .
we can not turn our back on belarus .
is the progress of democratis in belarus satisfactori ?
is this caus to turn our back on minsk again ?
but let u not push the le nobl into the hand of moscow .
experi ha taught u that all dictatorship come to an end !
this should be the aim .
today we are experienc a fundament chang in the situat .
( the presid cut off the speaker . )
his govern is in critic financi troubl .
the concret step taken and plan by the eu are import .
( pl ) mr presid , eu-belarus relat depend on both side .
( the presid cut off the speaker . )
democraci is vital .
last i would like to mention visa arrang .
the road to europ must be open .
i have said this repeat , and will say it again today .
independ journalist are still be persecut .
chang is on it way , howev , albeit veri slowli .
europ should support econom reform in belarus .
these should includ a requir for greater medium freedom .
it is time to make a summari of the discus .
i call on deputi prime minist vondra to sum up .
i think we are listen care .
i will now make perhap three point in conclus .
first , on visa fee , which mani of you have mention .
this is a problem of which we are particular awar .
let me be clear here .
so you are right - this is an import factor .
we are not yet at the point of have one general agreement .
that , again , would have to be negoti by the commiss .
the debat is close .
the vote will take place on thursday 15 januari 2009 .
written declar ( rule 142 )
it is obvious that belarus is play on two front .
look back , much more could have been done , and earlier .
that is a great shame and we deepli regret this fact .
a lot of good endeavour have been carri out .
srebrenica stand a a symbol of horror and inconsol grief .
remembr is a pain a it is necessari .
but recognit alon is not suffici .
justic is equal essenti .
war , concentr camp , genocid - never again !

srebrenica is a symbol of ethnic clean .

commission , i absolut disagre with you .
howev , when will we have a propos ?
this is someth i would veri much like to know .
howev , we should go further still .
we should not simpli talk about a time limit .
there is a lot of cruelti to anim dure transport .
judg by how we treat our anim , we are still barbarian .
this wa an area in which we were to improv the situat .
then came the first direct in 2005 .
five countri have not even bother to submit a report .
i demand that the commiss fine these countri immedi .
how have they compli with the rule ?
is it work ?
the answer in mani case is unfortun not .
we need to revisit the condit for anim dure transport .
that is how den pack the anim are at present .
who would want to be transport under such condit ?
i wonder how mani will accept that invit .
perhap they would rather amend the legisl .
we talk about cost .
they result in a veri real reduct in valu .
no , we need a new propos befor the elect .
we must take account of this when we lay down legisl .
this is not current be done .
more and more anim are be transport within the eu .
that realli is unaccept .
this wa when the eu compris 15 member state .
they will , of cours , be veri much higher .
i would also like to ask mr špidla a coupl of question .

it is import to minimis that where possibl .
that is an area we need to look at .
i would say : no more rule .
mr jensen spoke of 24-hour transport - not necessarili .

instead , peopl treat this behaviour a disobedi .
the owner beat the hors .
second , monitor remain the achill ' heel of this legisl .
i know the commiss can access that , but individu can not .
i would like answer to those three specif question plea .

we have one new administr in the unit state .
the outcom of the indian elect may give u anoth .
we would welcom him .
if we are open , then they need to be open too .
what can we expect from china ?
madam presid , the doha round broke down last year .
this is an extrem serious state of affair .
this sort of financi crisi result in a global depress .
the last time , it brought hitler to power .
these are import issu that we are talk about here .
there are mani worri sign .
we are see the first sign .
this may be the begin .
the trend are clear to see .
if this process start it will not be possibl to stop it .
this realli will be disastr .
there are ground for pessim .
the key to success lie in the agricultur sector .
noth can be more import than that .
thank you for the opportun to speak .
we have seen this throughout histori .
i would therefor like to ask the commiss a question .
thank you veri much .
madam presid , i should like to welcom the commission .
i think we should rememb that .
we are concern about it , a we should be .
it should be an issu that is discus at the doha level .
perhap i am wrong .
then we will be abl to speak of equal competit .
member will know that this is base on the 1979 trade act .
i have read the legisl .
i too am veri concern about it .
mr ford rais some of the issu about bilater relat .
this is about industri growth and develop .
mr wortmann-kool talk about servic .
i agre this is veri import .
it is veri import too to be transpar .
i could not agre more with that .
the debat is close .
of cours the sector is at the cut edg of globalis .
small and medium-s enterpris play a huge part in this .
that ha been support by the social partner .
the challeng for the sector predat the current slowdown .
of cours currenc devalu remain on our agenda .
we must keep a close eye on matter and we must be respons .
it is of crucial import to the region economi .
that is what we must be awar of , onc and for all .
almost 20 000 worker may becom unemploy .
what doe the commiss suggest textil manufactur do ?
we are count on you not to let this simpli pas unchalleng .
that is not the onli matter of concern , commission .
these initi do not have to cost anyth .
it is simpli a matter of polit will and coordin .
this is not at all a matter of promot trade barrier .
what role will commerci polici play in this context ?
( the presid cut off the speaker )
that is whi a more open market is realli the top prioriti .
that would natur help to safeguard job a well .
i am veri grate .
- the debat is close .
written statement ( rule 142 )
- the next item is the joint debat on :
concern the gas crisi , what is the current state of play ?
what are the lesson to be learnt ?
what were the weak we discov ?
the first wa the lack of infrastructur .
it is the part of the recoveri packag relat to energi .
i believ this is the right propos .
what are we propos ?
then there is the long term , which is veri import .
we basic know what must be done .
it is just a matter of translat word into action .
otherwis citizen in the member state will lose confid .
great ambit have appear and peopl like to hear them .
that would be ideal .
howev , i person would urg realism .
now , at what level ?
first , of cours , at the level of ict product themselv .
we hope this work will be achiev by invest in research .
of cours , we start with research .
there are mani import project at the moment .
energi is one of life 's basic necess .
in addit , we need to enrich our energi mix .
in conclus , let me present my opinion on the amend tabl .
the come week will be crucial in this respect .
assur should be sought , but notic should also be serv .
this ha happen befor , and it must not happen again .
upfront , there are cost .
that is the energi futur that europ must champion .
one exampl is the southern corridor .
final , i would like to turn to extern relat .
that did not happen .
mr presid , commission , solidar is a love word .
it general belong to the vocabulari of the left .
that can not be solidar .
this is the best way to counteract asymmetr market open .
this would not appear to be the best way forward .
more clariti on this in the report would have been welcom .
we need to develop more biofuel .
i must also emphasis the issu of nuclear power .
i would like to conclud on that note .
unit in diver is the motto of the european union .
this is total unaccept .
this is total unaccept .
thank you .
this show that the risk remain and is perhap increas .
we have had veri heat debat about it .
there is talk of long-term measur .
in point of fact , the prioriti is plain for all to see .
there is noth cheaper and noth that will creat more job .
second , there is renew energi .
third , there is gas to tide u over .
how is that suppos to happen ?
just look at the fact !
not a penni for energi effici !
not a penni for town-twin !
i find that so contradictori and so utter wrong .
( c ) thank you , i shall be brief .
the reactor met all the criterion for safe oper .
in fact the opposit is true .
it may also show it passiv and risk marginalis .
we need consumpt that is manag in accord with product .
we must have smart grid and smart hous .
this would not be the case with smart grid .
we could promot a clean futur for u all .
it is veri import .
invest in ukrain seem to be of special import for u .
the reason for such a step on our part is veri simpl .
what doe it mean ?
it is veri import for u .
they have becom the greatest challeng for u .
this is thus a veri serious issu .
they are a remind of our extravag .
we find it odd that ukrain is a transit countri .
we need smart meter now .
thank you .
we are on the verg of an energi crisi and a financi crisi .
this is an import issu for the futur .
we could get a better handl on employ and energi .
the commiss can make a signific contribut to this .
final , i would like to thank the rapporteur for her work .
these propos should be reject .
the baltic sea is one of our most sensit inland sea .
a land-bas altern must be thorough investig instead .
that would be irrespons .
the answer is technolog .
it is also agre to invest .
no , it is the privat sector that will have to do that .
we are not speak with one voic .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
idea have alreadi emerg regard potenti altern .
what can be done now ?
thank you veri much .
here , unfortun , we also need polit will .
we know the answer .
we all would then gain from competit .
i want to draw attent to two issu .
i call upon the european commiss then to take firm action .
the second issu is the capac for energi storag .
tell child to turn thing off is just not the solut .
i wish it were , a it would mean that i wa in control .
so , clear , we have a particular problem .
in particular the issu of land use need to be address .
the ensu emerg rais mani question .
how are we work on nord and south stream , and on nabucco ?
we hope for your understand .
in ireland we have 12 day of gas suppli at ani one time .
( the presid cut off the speaker . )
in europ we pay around usd 400 .
final there is the matter of the nabucco pipelin .
do you forese ani obstacl to that in the council ?
we do , howev , also have our own energi sourc .
it is true that each of u see the detail differ .
there are no simpl solut , no silver bullet to solv this .
a lot of you spoke about the supergrid .
supergrid is the tool that wa seen a a magic solut .
that will solv a lot of issu .
second , a european bodi for transmiss system oper .
what is the council discus ?
i think there are basic two issu .
the second issu is 'a fair return for my countri ' .
if it fail , we will look for altern .
again i would like to thank you for this debat .
what are the energi sourc ?
i wish to say that we do need to be care .
all that is for 2030 .
thus , nuclear energi is part of the mix , and coal too .
- thank you , mr laperrouz .
the joint debat is close .
the vote will take place on wednesday .
written statement ( rule 142 )
energi matter are the greatest challeng of our time .
this requir interconnect .
ladi and gentleman .
thank you .
obvious this wa a polit shot in the foot .
the eu need to break out of it own vicious circl at last .
this mistaken standpoint can onli lead to erron consequ !
this issu involv more than just energi !
this is about much , much more than energi !
link the network will also stimul competit in the region .
'a pole is wise after the event ! '
these are matter about which there is no disagr .
mr presid , ladi and gentleman .
there are no nation solut to europe-wid problem .
now onli the polit will is miss .

written statement ( rule 142 )
unfortun we are still a long way away from them .
wilder in europ ( short present )

their valuabl suggest have enhanc the report .
it is a terribl phenomenon whose scale is unknown .
the european union ha arm itself with legisl on the issu .
that , howev , is not enough .
the member state are not satisfi .
i must say that i am not satisfi either .
it is import for u to make definit progress in this area .
in this field there is a lot to do .
thank you .
onli an all-embrac approach will be success .
we must put everi effort into combat it .
this must be a legal bind oblig .

at the same time , sever nation law constrain surveil .
there have also been such case in other member state .
we must achiev this .
thank you .
this concern everi aspect of life .
that is whi i am strong in favour of the report .
i think we will all support such a report .
unfortun , this is what is go on on the internet .
it is a crime and should be treat a such .
i therefor thank mr angelilli for her report .
i have rais this subject mani time myself .
prophylact and prevent measur are need in this area .
rapid crime detect and strict enforc of penalti are imper .
cooper is need from the medium .
this is a reproach of our time .
a stranger arous interest .
are we , a parent , helpless ?
no , we are not .
perhap it is difficult to get them away from their comput .
dear parent , do someth today to protect your child .
it is such a simpl messag .
we had a recent case in ireland which highlight this .
( bg ) mr angelilli 's report is veri time and import .
it will be easier to carri out investig and bring charg .
i will say no more on this .
i have also had question on extraterritori .
that is the current think .
there is also a need for tool .
in particular , the access provid have to be mobilis .
this is fundament .
first , there is a lack of data .
the debat is close .
the vote will take place today .
written statement ( rule 142 )
inde , groom child must be consid an offenc .
in that regard , i urg the eu to take the lead .
in write . - exploit child in ani way is unaccept .
child need our care and protect a legisl .
we must rais the level of protect .
what is take place on the internet ha surpass all limit .
we realli must .
this , howev , is a struggl against consequ .
in order to prevent crime , one must increas awar .
i wa not one of those who support it .
articl 10 is , in my view , the key articl .
the commiss will be vigil about the inspect .
person , i do not see ani drawback .
this direct should be adopt and implement quick .
my thank go to parliament , mr fava and the libe committe .
there is a view that this legisl will not bring ad valu .
inde , the debat on legal migrat is be held elsewher .
a ever , though , this is about effect monitor .
what exact did we achiev by way of this law ?
we attack incent .
what kind of incent are we refer to ?
a of now , this will be absolut imposs .
thank you .
claudio fava deserv our congratul on this in particular .
this pressur is consider , and right so , frank .
that too , my group will accept .
this is , quit frank , unaccept , in my view .
there is thus no guarante that payment will be made .
it is clear a problem that ha been over-exagger .
with this direct , the exploit pay more than the exploit .
we need someth differ .
we need a measur to curb xenophobia .
i am afraid it will get quit a lot wors .
well , it is not surpris is it ?
we do not want that either .
we are not protectionist , but we want good common sen .
this is a well-balanc direct .
the sanction are certain suitabl and in proport .
this direct doe not strike the right balanc .
this situat is degrad and should be stop .
instead , an open method of coordin is what is need here .
it is therefor not enough to tackl the employ .
we must address illeg immigr in it entir context .
no one disput this .
howev , there is one thing that i do not understand .
this is coward and unhelp .
there is , of cours , one thing that we can be sure of .
this is whi we will be vote in favour of this report .
it repres the first step in the right direct .
establish legal penalti certain repres a step forward .
we have taken the first step forward .
now we should go the rest of the way togeth .
i trust that they will prove to be effect .
it wa no easi task and the path wa strewn with pitfal .
mani of them die on their way to our contin .
this is not worthi of the european union .
there is a shame paradox here .
this will reduc the chanc of find a decent life in europ .
we have a four-parti govern with strong liber element .
congratul , therefor , to mr fava .
what will becom of them ?
this is what we know a modern slaveri .
we need to be firm , to send out a clear messag .
we need courag provis that are conscienti appli .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
mr fava is certain to be commend .
nonetheless , the law is not work .
do not complain that the union ...
( the presid cut off the speaker )
someon is make a good profit out of them .
we need to draw up legisl which is equal to this complex .
whi ha it not been includ ?
they have becom illeg worker .
these sector use illeg labour to an alarm degre .
this measur therefor come at just the right moment .
these sanction will further deter employ from hire worker .
the growth of illeg work serious undermin econom competit .
the provis may well turn out to be useless .
then we could all agre that this is a good direct .
the employ benefit most from the effort of illeg worker .
they can easili procur a cheap labour forc .
the latter often exploit their despair .
it seem to me to be a good first step .
there you have it .
thank you a well for the qualiti of this debat .
the debat is close .

this is the question which we must ask ourselv today .
some peopl alleg that the prison have been tortur .
howev , is that the onli aspect which we have to consid ?
we have not yet done this , for good reason .
we must also do that in this case .
this is the wrong messag .
guantánamo is a place of shame .
it is a place of tortur .
the charter doe not state that this inviol can be reduc .
( applaus )
it is a conundrum we must solv togeth .
after septemb 11 , though , noth is standard ani longer .
these are no ordinari inmat .
three thing are absolut certain regard this matter .
would you ask the u now who the inmat are ?
their fundament human right have been disregard .
this is unaccept !
we are hesit and start a shame period of horse-trad .
i regard this a a cynic approach .
the u militari base at guantánamo must also be remov .
thank good for that .
those who are not convict should be treat a innoc .
thank you for the opportun to speak .
final , we should not be fixat on guantánamo .
can we be ask to take that risk in the eu ?
perhap he thought that it wa an amus park .
we ask : and what about the citizen ' right to know ?
that must impli an offer of practic assist .
i just want to deal with a coupl of thing .
we know of two who have becom involv in terror .
that is not return to terror ' .
my hope and wish is for this to be the case .
and they have been accomplic in that polici .
and this is whi we must insist they be held account .
the american peopl have done so through the poll .
if there is no proof , then they must be releas .
thank you veri much .
in legal term , i think the issu is clear .
there is no shortag of these in the unit state of america .
i believ this is the case for most peopl here .
the end do not justifi the mean .
( nl ) presid obama ha kept his word .
this is base pure on assumpt .
yet it is clear that we did not creat it ourselv .
this is a clear duti that we should carri out .
i welcom mr barrot 's declar of intent to this end .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
i entir agre with messr schulz and watson .
the european union must collabor .
i believ that this is total adequ .
that is their choic .
howev , one thing must be made clear .
we should think care about that .
we look away ; we turn our back .
proactiv think on human right is regrett select in the eu .
someon today spoke about refuge .
these are not refuge .
howev , they have also made huge mistak .
it wa a huge mistak to creat guantánamo .
it wa a huge mistak to treat detaine a they did .
it wa a huge mistak to transport them a they did .
this ha been said in this parliament .
how is the european union involv ?
europ need to feel respons for the war on global terror .
often , these method amount to tortur .
the chechen nation wa murder befor our veri eye .
i refer to a polish citizen age 42 who wa kidnap .
he is a geologist who wa work there .
he ha been held in the area ever sinc .
some of them have not even been charg and duli tri .
it closur is now a matter for the unit state .
the martin report is the best exampl of this approach .
these are classic asylum case .
we join the fight against terror to defend human right .
one the one hand , there is the legal posit .
this is a serious problem that merit consider .
i believ it wa veri use .
it is certain more complex than that .
it is not about wash ourselv but not get wet .
there is also the tactic debat .
this is one level .
so there is an intern imper for a coordin approach .
it ha onli been one week .
it is a key turn point in the fight against terror .
this realli is the essenti condit .
that is absolut essenti .
thank you everyon .
the debat is close .
no one ha been abl to prove their exist in romania .
may the eu be asham of it failur to act .
all parti stand to gain by such an approach .
we are , of cours , talk here about asylum seeker .
i now turn to mayott .
those are the remark i wish to make to you .
yes , you heard correct , i said 30 % of the popul .
the french author are well awar of these difficulti .
this should be open in june 2011 .
today , we have spoken about the closur of guantánamo .
most of those who are in lampedusa are asylum seeker .
the urgenc is great , and ha been for a while .
it is all empti word and no action .
the lack of solidar is shock .
and this is quit apart from enforc .
how will it be spent ?
it is someth that is includ in your press releas .
i have prepar a dossier and sent it to mr barrot .
the detent centr wa not built to cope with this capac .
we have known this for three year .
i am sorri that he is not here in the hous .
what is the consequ of this ?
i believ that it is import to give you a few figur .
in 2007 , around 11 000 migrant arriv in lampedusa .
in 2008 , three time a mani arriv , about 31 000 .
76 request were examin in 3 day .
after the assert that have been made , be patient .
the citizen are not annoy with the italian govern .
what therefor should be done : ignor the rule ?
enough then of demagogueri !
those who come normal present themselv a asylum seeker .
when that happen , we must preserv the rule of law .
we must treat these peopl a free citizen and with respect .
what we are talk about now seem veri strang to me .
the same must be done in itali .
this is import work at both domest and intern level .
that is to say , those who qualifi are accept .
of cours , we in the european union must show solidar .
these repres quit a signific number .
i want to make this veri clear .
this two-fac approach is no longer accept .
we should not help them .
what ha been said is fals .
maroni expo this .
this should be our main object .
thank you .
let me start with the negat - the limit .
now is the time to gradual implement that step by step .
there are strateg issu .
europ need to show greater solidar .
europ ha to decid what solidar is requir .
that is absolut essenti
that is not possibl .
that is not the aim of this fund .
the debat is close .
question time ( commiss )
the next item is question time ( b6-0006/09 ) .
the follow question are address to the commiss .
is it will to allow a compens system ?
econom interest , by contrast , are not suffici .

that is the main idea .
we are interest in look .

i read about it in the newspap .
i do not know anyth about heysel .
noth ha been decid .
it is a process .
it will be a transpar process .
subject : euro note and coin counterfeit

so this ha been promis at least .
subject : effici spend of the eu budget
the system is a follow .
next come implement , where there are differ layer .
this is one intern part .
there is also improv in this area .
so the situat is improv .
we can show what ha been done .
but we can also clear say that this is far from perfect .
this is a huge machin which must work smooth .
but 11 % repres eur 462 million .
doe the commission think that this is accept ?
this is a mess , commission !
can we expect that this is go to be improv ?
these sampl amount to eur 63 million .
therefor , the 12 % issu from 2006 is resolv .
these are the possibl fraud case .
would you support this idea ?
concern the fund , i did not understand the question .
were you suggest that all the fund should be merg ?
could you repeat the question ?
vice-presid of the commiss . - that is a huge question .
i can onli pas this question to my colleagu .
so far , it ha been a veri heat debat in the council .
the idea , of cours , i can onli support .
subject : agreement with andean communiti countri
all of them are invit , of cours .
this wa a realli big achiev .
i should like to thank the commission .
let me make it clear that i condemn terror in all it form .
that seem to me to be a good step .
so this is a process which is dynam : it is not fix forev .
subject : futur eu-iceland relat
the commiss is close follow this debat .
this is my opinion .
i think this will be the key element in futur negoti .
subject : demographi report
thank you for your answer , commission .
you talk about the need of an age popul .
certain care-giv is one of those .
i would like you perhap to elabor more on that .
final , carer work : they are unpaid worker .

the task is simpli too difficult and they can not cope .
a the author is not present , question 51 lap .

the union ha also act concern the situat of the rom minor .
that is what i can tell you .
we have inherit the result of all this .
thank you .
it can not abandon minor at this time of crisi .
other are discrimin against or disavow .
( applaus )
they share this view .
i believ that the rom need more support from the state .
this negat the purpos of the agreement .
in those school , slovak is taught for four hour a week .
each social group is differ .
you should either love your receiv countri or get out .
a specif mention must be made about the rom minor .
it could caus enorm human unhappi .
( hu ) thank you veri much , mr presid .
this is a loss to repres democraci .
( the speaker continu in basqu )
educ is , by it own natur , unifi rather than divis .
in fact , it teach u that we are all someon el 's minor .
their loyalti ha been unbroken .
thank you veri much .

the member state will not allow u to .
the debat is close .
written statement ( rule 142 )
no countri in contemporari europ deni the right of minor .
it appear that europ is of one mind on this .
this provok a reaction by the major .
this ha happen , for exampl , to pole in germani .
germani is therebi violat the fundament right of minor .
this is an aberr in the european union .
this is not accept .
we have examin specif case in the committe on petit .
i do not have anoth passport .
i do not have anoth countri .
i onli have this countri and i can not vote . '
that is an aberr .
how is that possibl ?
no wonder the naturalis rate is slow .
they do not particip .
they do not take decis .
is this situat good or bad for the european union ?
this is a question for the commiss and council .
particip begin at local communiti level .
the eu must take action on their behalf .
whi doe the commiss not act on this ?
these peopl are call non-citizen .
this is , quit simpli , unaccept .
i do not believ it should be toler .
those languag were simpli ban .
today , the realiti is that they are co-offici .
i take except to that .
it is up to the member state to decid such issu .
whi that is , i do not know .
what doe that mean ?
thank you .
i am from ireland ; i speak english .
we have had to deal with that .
we must encourag them to particip polit .
they can all vote in local elect in ireland .
such a posit is also in line with intern law and practic .
this is a uniqu case in parliamentari histori .
do not reject it .
you can take citizenship .
there wa a palestinian exil who took latvian citizenship .

the procedur in a horizont committe wa new .
that ha been the greatest advantag of this committe .
the report is also honest .
we have state that we do not have ani super weapon .
the report is therefor direct at u all .
that is the wonder thing about it .
i am particular plea about that .
nor doe it disparag ani area .
if we understand that , then this task ha been worthwhil .
the copenhagen confer is now onli 10 month away .
your report ha therefor come along at the right time .
we can and must reach an agreement .
there is no time to lose .
one illustr element is the measur announc recent for car .
i welcom your contribut to this major effort .
howev , that alon will not be enough .
all these area deserv our full attent and an effect solut .
we want retrain programm for the new green poll worker .
consider invest are need .
our fourth core theme is agricultur .
our fifth core theme , final , is about involv peopl .
this requir the provis of inform and transpar .
local initi are veri valuabl in this regard .
togeth , we can achiev a great deal .
with this set of measur , there is also reason for optim .
the minist is fli to india today .
but this planet ha finit resourc .
we need to slow and revers our popul growth .
contracept must be avail for all .
our refus to place it there is the greatest folli .
famili everywher should be talk about this .
govern should be set target for popul stabil or reduct .
the market is there .
the regulatori framework is clear .
we have set the target for renew energi .
there will be long-term gain if we step up to the mark .
the job and wealth will flow .
we have the technolog patent .
delay at this point would be detriment .
green technolog is our futur .
we have the opportun now , so let u use it .
i would like to mention three thing in particular .
a larg proport of this feed is export to europ a soya .
this is not sustain .
the car industri is anoth grow problem .
should we not encourag local product and consumpt instead ?
therefor , plea vote against amend 12 and 28 .
thank you veri much .
we need tough goal for the period between 2020 and 2050 .
not one section of societi should escap make effort .
they were wrong .
they were wrong .
they were wrong .
noth at all happen .
it , too , is wrong .
nor is it a consensus .
the onli way we can be realli effect is to improv effici .
i would , howev , like to focus on the content .
i have here some statist on our work .
we are look at a lifestyl chang .
against that measur we are still fail .
we are fail in not bring suffici ambit to this debat .
we are fail in not bring enough urgenc to this debat .
we are fail in not be consist .
today , we speak of renew and energi effici .
twenti per cent by 2020 wa a start - but onli a start .
we hear that a meet will take place on 6 march 2009 .
we need to move on to ship and to agricultur emiss .
they will be devast , but they did not caus this problem .
devast will come to agricultur .
they must take action , but they need our help .
i may be wrong about the possibl flu pandem .
i may be wrong about the probabl impact of global warm .
that lead to credibl result , a we can see .
we have , howev , lack the financi instrument .
- ( sv ) this report promis a great deal .
altern fuel are also treat with far too much restraint .
there are option here , too .
it is , of cours , possibl to creat job in europ .
they are need here .
we need to anchor the measur in econom polici .
we must creat a basi for develop in the field of energi .
do you not understand this ?
i would recommend it to them .
i should like to thank karl-heinz florenz for his report .
the report befor u is long ; it make mani point .
so we have to get this packag of measur right .
there is not much time left .
we need to think long term .
thank you .
this is complet short-sight .
- madam presid , we have here an ambiti plan .
this simpl statement wa the first to be attack and remov .
what wa so objection to the committe ?
the word creation ' .
becaus creation ha a creator .
i do not want discus the detail of this report .
in my opinion , it should simpli be adopt .
this ha been our great achiev .
commission , it is an excel decis .
we must now speedili examin it in parliament .
that is the assumpt behind mr florenz 's report .
that is what is most import to u today .
we must urgent find mean of fight global warm .
with a budget of eur 76 billion , we are wide of the mark .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
third , biofuel are hail a environmentally-friend altern .
provid incent may help to achiev this goal .
what a climat masterstrok .
you need to draw a graph show how co2 perhap caus warm .
we are near on the flat line , if not alreadi there .
extra co2 will have no more effect .
there is no problem .
madam presid , i would like to thank mr florenz .
all these factor will acceler warm .
we can control emiss but we can not control these factor .
i would have like it to be at the core of the report .
final , let me just endors what guido sacconi said .
what is need from u today ?
if you do not do this , you will lose out in the end .
this is the right approach , in my view .
a such , this approach can count on my back .
a such , we will oppos this paragraph .
a great deal can be done there .
howev , we must also look to the futur .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
scienc is onli what fit into the polit concept .
we must also get other contin and countri on board .
water play a central role in climat chang .
this is an interest approach , minist bursík .
i believ that it will win your support .
it is import not to give up on such a complex problem .
miracl rare happen .
let u go beyond discus .
let u make sure that the member state make a solid commit .
yet , there is someth we should be worri about .
it is a way of reduc energi bill , which will plea consum .
what is need ?
everi initi we have launch must be speed up .
what sort of thing , for exampl ?
ultim , this is perhap the most difficult task .
agricultur is often depict a the big caus of climat chang .
quit the opposit .
final , i would like to say the follow .
great import must ...
( the presid cut off the speaker )
- madam presid , i would like to thank the rapporteur .
the report would perhap be better without them .
polici , legisl and financ must work togeth .
the report provid a fantast platform for this .
without this we are left to trivial and the mundan .
the transport sector must reduc co2 emiss by 20 % by 2020 .
we know how import .
in franc , we speak of a théodul committe ' .
so , yes , we must be more ambiti and we await the result .
we had a lot of expert in the committe , that is true .
unfortun , howev , they repres onli one view .
we did not get the chanc to hear all side of the debat .
i think this wa a mistak .
in my opinion , we have a veri good start point in 2009 .
the enorm valu of this wa brought home to me in bali .
not at all .
we intend to coordin the negoti .
whi the six win ' ?
let u consid the ambit .
we will be take a veri intens lead in intern negoti .
this conclud my statement .
there will be a big stakehold ' meet on 30 march 2009 .

oral explan of vote
so we have to involv the countri of asia .

i do not support the report .
the adopt of this report is bad news for eu citizen .
i do not agre with this .
there is no progress without water .
we need to rationalis water usag .
the evid for climat chang is controversi .
i do not share this view .
they relat specif to agricultur livestock product .
there is alreadi good work be done in this area .
colleagu , do you not think our voter have notic ?
if you think i am wrong , prove me wrong .
that mean put the lisbon treati to a referendum .
pactio olisipiensi censenda est .
- madam presid , this is a dread piec of legisl .
it is nonsens .
this piec of legisl should never see the light of day .
most import of all is polit independ .
energi suppli must not be a sourc of polit blackmail .
howev , this start with the educ of our child .
here it is onc again in the european parliament .
we talk about climat chang .
we talk about energi effici .
that is whi i said i vote for this reluct .
a far a the unit state wa concern , it work .
i will not be hold my breath .
are we mad ?
therefor i did not vote for the resolut .
they are not exact squeaki clean .
this is problemat , to say the least .
mine wa among the voic rais in concern .
we spoke , we insist , a friend of the unit state .
well , here is our chanc to vindic that boast .
they have shown the will .
they have listen to u .
it is time for u to listen to the voic that count .
written explan of vote
my respons wa clear : ratifi the lisbon treati .
climat chang is a fact .
some scientist nevertheless express qualifi doubt over it .
with this provis i agre with the report .
the major defect are financi .
nevertheless , this is an essenti element .
this is absurd .
the report is veri sprawl .
this is whi a joint effort is requir involv all countri .
ireland must remain a nuclear-fre island .
i wish you all a good day .
i thank you all .
this can bring numer benefit .
differ countri have the right to set differ object .
i vote for the florenz report .
let u make the effort .
this includ invest in new technolog .
it is not possibl to produc a balanc report on this basi .
howev , i have some reserv .
this report ha various merit .
the first is that it ha an educ object .
unfortun , the limit to this report are also numer .
they do poor paid job , often border on exploit .
energi effici programm have the potenti to creat job .
i therefor vote to abstain on this resolut .
the resolut , howev :
this is an import step toward a new begin in u polici .
willing and caution should be the criterion adopt .
now , each prison should stand trial .
there are current around 242 prison held at guantánamo .
these peopl have not been charg with ani crime .
correct to vote and vote intent : see minut
approv of the minut of the previous sit
( the minut of the previous sit were approv )
i want to remind mr pöttere and all his vice-presid -
mr lundgren , i am now cut you off .
you have exceed your speak time by more than half .
i have taken note of what you have said .
i believ that it is clear to everyon .
he would not have been interrupt by you .
this is the great differ .
but you prove my point - thank you veri much .
- mr lundgren , i am sure that you are mistaken .
kosovo ( debat )
i think that this is unfair .
howev , i would like to ask you to think about this care .
we need to find a differ arrang in this type of case .
this ha been welcom by the council .
we will alloc a further eur 106 million in 2009 .
the commiss take all these issu veri serious .
perhap i can say a few word on each of them in turn .
gender equal is high on our agenda a well .
our financi assist is comprehens .
our support for rom in kosovo also includ educ .
this work is veri import .
this is the onli way in which kosovo will flourish .
we can confirm that the situat in kosovo is improv .
mr pack ha also touch on this subject .
we can not take respons for the develop of kosovo .
these are not mere empti word with no real mean .
the road ahead is a long one , and it will be difficult .
that wa absolut not what wa intend .
this is whi we are there and whi we need to remain there .
the eu ha launch the eulex mission in kosovo .
eulex ha , and i quot , certain execut respons ' .
we are caught up in this .
i should like to underlin two thing .
there is no way back for kosovo within serbia 's border .
this is europ 's commit with regard to the western balkan .
this demonstr that this develop is irrevers .
the first major risk is the divis of kosovo .
this would give rise to a high danger situat .
we should not add fuel to the fire .
final , we should promot the integr of the entir region .
of cours , all the countri will have to do their homework .
un secur council resolut 1244 remain in forc .
it is quit simpl : kosovo belong to serbia .
that phase is over , howev .
- ( sv ) i wa born in the balkan .
the court should ensur that war crime are address .
this is what the whole european idea is about .
( applaus )
that is exact what kosovo need .
the primari respons for this lie with the kosovar author .
corrupt and crime undermin the state .
woman and minor must also be fulli involv .
it is good that the real work ha now begun .
i veri much hope so .
the effect of aid must be paramount in this .
mr pack and i visit kosovo not so long ago .
for all these reason , the athisaari plan fail .
it must enjoy the european perspect in a region context .
we need to appli the same standard in everi region .
it wa a harsh lesson .
kosovo stand a a warn to eu member state a well .
serbia ha one more chanc : vojvodina .
this final report ha not yet been implement .
we await an explan .
this final report realli is a final report .
there is no follow-up organis .
eulex itself can not do this job .
i think that the posit of the council is exact the same .
we have a lot of challeng ahead of u .
the first is the indivis and stabil of kosovo .
let me congratul joost lagendijk on the work which he did .
it wa excel .
there is no easi solut .
onc again , thank you veri much .
we will continu this cooper .
it is the onli way our work in kosovo can bear fruit .

impact of the financi crisi on the car industri ( debat )
we should be proud of europ 's record .
this mean focus clear on innov .
experi show that car are an earli indic of econom trend .
whi is this the case ?
consum behav no differ to enterpris in this respect .
that repres 6 % of all the job in the european union .
our biggest export surplus is in motor vehicl .
in 2007 , we produc 19.6 million motor vehicl in europ .
there are current stockpil of 2 million unsold vehicl .
in simpl term , then , it is a key industri for europ .
the plight of commerci vehicl is much more dramat .
the industri itself conced an overcapac of 20 % .
there are peopl who say it is much higher still .
do not reproach me for describ the fact a they are .
this is not critic on my part ; it is mere an observ .
that is the onli way to surviv this competit situat .
that is the realiti of the current situat .
our polici now is pursu two goal at the same time .
nine billion euro is alreadi on the tabl .
i would like to mention just one exampl in this regard .
it is just not possibl to do this .
we are do that .
we have alreadi done all of this .
the consequ for europ would be catastroph if that happen .
the european motor industri is not stare into an abyss .
what are our fellow citizen expect today ?
therefor , europ should make a signific respons .
a genuin industri polici is essenti .
we must develop a science-fict cultur .
after all , we are all awar of the situat .
we are wit an extraordinari contradict .
and what happen ?
what happen is that each countri act independ .
some do one thing , other do anoth .
these task overlap with one anoth .
thank you .
swift , firm action is need .
innov can not be achiev by get rid of the worker .
there is a solut .
ladi and gentleman , let u be consist .
let u no longer cherish caus which are so detriment to u .
both group veri much need better access to credit .
a yet , these institut have no access to state aid .
i welcom the commiss propos to simplifi that fund .
onli a tini fraction of that fund wa use last year .
let u not hoard it .
let u put it to work to put our peopl to work .
what we need is a green new deal .
the crisi in the car industri is not a pure econom crisi .
they were quit simpli ignor climat chang .
that is come back to haunt them now .
this is neither social nor environmentally-mind .
in fact it is simpli crazi .
we must not go along with this .
volvo and saab are well-known make .
the industri is alreadi in serious troubl .
i have been through mani crise , but noth like this .
we do not want a competit race between busi .
nobodi ha ask for it , and we do not want it .
mr sacconi gave u the statist earlier .
i am think of tuscani , where i come from .
there is no time to lose , commission .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
this wa the case for coal and steel .
therefor , i would like to put forward four propos .
third , acceler the renew of the vehicl on the road .
premium for scrap vehicl can be effect .
howev , i would like to close on this point .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
tyre manufactur are just a sever affect .
dramat event , then , requir harmonis action .
it can be stretch to six minut , possibl seven .
howev , in this case , 12 member request the floor .
minist , you have the floor .
we are also watch develop in korea and japan etc .
that is the bottom line .
let me make that quit clear .
i do not know .
on this point , then , we are in complet agreement .
if there is one thing we will not be do , this is it .
our posit would not look too good in such a situat .
that is absolut imposs .
we agre on this at our meet of 16 januari in brussel .
the bureau took this decis unanim .
that is what wa decid .
of cours , this rule can be chang .
the debat is close .
written statement ( rule 142 )
these are not the onli problem which this sector is face .
what action can be expect ?
will we have a budget equal to the challeng face europ ?
this is of direct benefit to eu citizen .
the treati provid u with a basi for this cooper .
other consid it to be a servic provid by the state .
member state subsequ drew up guidelin to handl such crise .
the council ha recent develop the lead state ' concept .
this platform is call crisi coordin arrang ( cca ) .
sitcen provid logist and inform support .
the co-loc of consular facil is also under consider .
there is certain more that could be done .
squar this circl will remain a challeng .
that , then , is the situat on paper .
i realis that there are huge practic difficulti .
minist , you cite articl 20 of the treati .
it is veri clear .
everi citizen ha the right to consular protect .
it is not an option , it is a right .
financi support is visibl lack between the member state .
member state have a duti to put an end to this situat .
this is the least we can do .
furthermor , polic forc co-oper with each other .
there is no such thing a european citizenship .
a european , they do not exist outsid the european union .
in the best-cas scenario , consul help each other .
it is a pertin question .
we should expand the concept of european solidar .
it is extens but not exhaust .
more work need to be done there .
( de ) mr presid , mr karim is absolut right .
of cours it is .
quit simpli , such condit are unaccept .
mumbai will happen again .
realis this and , i urg you to be prepar for it .
we can not even actual agre on what articl 20 mean .
where are these ?
mumbai is a good exampl of how it doe not work .
i welcom the idea of a lead state which wa announc recent .
( the presid cut off the speaker . )
citizen expect action and not just word from the union .
i am sure this ha been the experi of mani other mep .
i have never been there so i do not know this person .

this is a common languag in this parliament .
do you realli think that is an ambiti goal ?
what are your aim ?

that would be rather ambiti .
president-in-offic of the council . - i will tri .

i hope that we will be abl to act a thorough a we can .
certain this is what the presid want to do .
it wa specif about the amount of the possibl eib loan .

this doe not augur well for a new doha round .
it doe not lie in the european union .
where , then , is the problem ?
so we are all hope for that .
subject : measur to improv the energi effici of build
what can the council do to implement this solut ?
what sort of timet do you consid to be realist ?
one is hous and energi effici .
i would like to deal with the question on financ .
i think we have the instrument .
one of the specif purpos is to promot the nabucco project .
i had a feel that it might aris at the time it did .
thank you .
that is one part of the stori .
one thing is the solidar a a polit slogan .
subject : tobacco control and smoke cessat
but now i have to respond to this question .
that is the substanc of my respons .
- i would like to thank the president-in-offic .
i do not mean to make him paranoid with my question .
it wa tabl , after all , last decemb .
i am anti-smok , not anti-smok .
they are amaz realli .
- thank you , president-in-offic , for your honesti .
my wife smoke a well and she still smoke .
parliament is sovereign .
so i have a dilemma .
what is more import : the lisbon treati or this ?
that conclud question to the council .
( the sit wa suspend at 7.15 p.m. and resum at 9.00 p.m . )
it is also an ecolog disast .
for exampl , the czech republ spontan offer it assist .
the 2003 heatwav claim ten of thousand of live .
in 2003 and 2007 forest fire ravag portug and greec .
there is also an urgent need with regard to the forest .
this is a situat that we must handl respons .
i repeat , i said that here , to this hous , last novemb .
you had this support , and continu to do so .
the council is not here this even .
it seem to me that we do this often , too often .
we know that the climat is increas unsettl .
face with all this , what is europ do ?
we suffer the consequ of this dure everi tragedi .
we are told to call for solidar ' , but use which fund ?
this storm alon ha cost eur 1.4 billion .
i now know what a major environment disast entail .
roof have been rip off , anim lost and feed store destroy .
in fact , this storm ha ravag 60 % of the land forest .
this is the third catastroph storm in 20 year .
it still hold the wind speed record : over 250 km/h .
it flatten most of our forest , for the first time .
the third storm wa on 24 januari 2009 .
second , i am also think of the oyster-farm .
today the profess is in dire strait .
obvious , i sympathis with what mr laperrouz ha said .
today , the council is not here .
they just allow peopl to die , week after week .
the debat is close .
written statement ( rule 142 )
dure the storm , wind gust at speed of up to 194 km/h .
the solidar fund is a use instrument .
it wa establish in the eu after the flood in august 2002 .
use of pcb wast oil in an irish food recycl plant ( debat )
nevertheless , addit effort are need .
in most case , this must be done by an on-the-spot visit .
these offici control must includ control on feed busi .
the fuel use wa appar contamin with pcb transform oil .
recycl is now the thing to do ' .
that is appropri if we have tight control on it .
we do not think outsid the box .
i think we need to look again at regul .
of cours , this is about ireland .
this is the most recent scandal in relat to food risk .
i have two question for the commission .
is there not an argument now for that direct to be review ?
in other word , those control work .
ten year ago in belgium , the case came thick and fast .
after 10 year , the case is now close in belgium .
one person got a suspend sentenc of one and a half year .
thus , the oil is dilut and ad to the feedstuff .
in both case , the oil in question is transform oil .
this is bad news in the current difficult econom climat .
polychlorin biphenyl are almost 100 year old .
he said , we have put into place so much traceabl .
and there is confus about other thing .
i have a seri of question for the commission .
is it a law unto itself a ha been suggest ?
whi wa there no equival scrutini of the millstream recycl ?
what ha been the effect of this ?
in my view , we have at least two problem .
the logic question is : whi did this not happen earlier ?
yet there are still problem in this area .
yes , we do want to make use of surplus foodstuff .
traceabl , howev , must be ensur .
that i understand .
we need to look at that issu .
that is whi i do not agre with proinsia .
this is a european issu becaus it ha a cross-bord dimens .
perhap the commission could clarifi that point .
that is not the issu .
there is a legal and polic investig .
we can not deni that .
they have suffer a well , i accept that .
this is not polit .
so this is serious stuff .
then we can draw our conclus and take decis for the futur .
i have here some figur .

sad , the answer is no ' .
i should like to make an observ with regard to inspect .
cannib : never again !
it is these which creat the most controversi .
industri will do everyth for profit .

procedur must be transpar and unambigu .

this report is harm , and it effect are pervers .
the nation recoveri of the european nation depend on it .
we vote in favour of mr muscardini 's report on smes .
it is signific especi now , in the face of econom collaps .
over 75 million peopl work in these smes .
they also punish the most effici and innov smes .
intern trade will onli be fair if it is so for both parti .
we therefor abstain .
this also concern cross-bord transact .
it ha open up new market and broken down barrier to trade .
the protect of intellectu properti must not favour abus .
a far a we are concern , these epa are a con .
this is not the road map ' describ in the schröder report .
that is whi i shall vote against it .
i am sceptic a to whether kosovo wa readi for independ .
this mean that sad , i can not support it .
i vote against in both case .

china current account for 6 % of world trade .
it is understand .
nevertheless , this trade is there , and it is grow .
it is a countri which is a drive forc of world growth .

that wa realli when we began work on esdp .
nobodi can fail to see what ha been achiev .
i think this is the european way of do thing .
the cfsp is more than an instrument .
by work togeth , by act togeth , we defin who we are .
i think this is an import concept to keep in mind .
the three report make refer to that document .
this is veri import .
this is the modern approach to crisi manag .
civilian action is not possibl without a secur environ .
let me say a word on afghanistan .
we have to deliv and to deliv in a sensibl manner .
more engag will be need .
i think we will have to work in that direct .
thank you for your attent .
these are thing that we welcom .
this ha been abund demonstr by the speaker befor me .
usual , we do not get much further than eleg allus .
we are entitl to feel increas isol .
the limit of our effect are to be found in european capit .
my group is oppos to gloss over our own work .
that said , the strateg dilemma is clear .
mr solana , you are absolut right .
i say this becaus we are at a histor junctur .
so what is it that we are talk about , then ?
i will turn now to mr von wogau 's report .
this report discus a new concept : safe .
i do not know how long that window will stay open .
we do not share the view that this is the way forward .
we believ this is wrong .
each new eu militari mission is problemat .
what war will be next ?
nato stand for the polit of war .
the report label nato a the core of european secur ' .
nato stand for insecur !
what is need is the disband of nato .
sixti year of nato is sixti year too mani .
we will therefor be vote against these two report .
is it fiction ?
this is essenti , after all .
this doe not mean adopt an opposit posit .
to begin with , resourc and mean .
someon spoke about helicopt .
the helicopt ha today becom an essenti crisi manag tool .
europ doe not want to be a militari power .
this ha help mani finn to act a peacebuild .
this will not happen if our union keep idl in one place .
this should be nurtur and support by all of u .
innov creat new busi and job .
sure , in other word , a european armi .
a we all know , esdp produc no militari ad valu .
it is a polit tool in the advanc of an integr europ .
it should be seen for what it is .
this would actual be help .
we use to call it heart and mind ' .
today that is the number of the high repres .
respect is need for the posit of the republ of cyprus .
third , it is time to address new challeng to our secur .
mr allist is a typic exampl .
that approach is antiqu .
we have the resourc .
will we , one day , have the will ?
what are those respons exact ?
it play a use , even essenti role .
nato , howev , is constant expand .
it activ extend beyond it geograph framework .
nato is thus violat the unit nation charter .
ladi and gentleman , you are complet inconsist .
we have to put an end to this and get out of it .
nato ha had it time .
we realli are push for time .
i would therefor ask you to plea keep to your speak time .
afghanistan is also an import issu .
this bring the european union in immedi .
it doe not appear that way to me !
thank you .
our defenc industri may be threaten .
at the time , the european communiti wa powerless .
( c ) let u celebr the sixtieth anniversari of nato .
there will soon be some major us-eu-nato summit .
let u construct a joint european leadership .
let u rationalis the european defenc market .
let u not wast it .
( c ) i would like to say a few word on eu-russia relat .
the european public expect this from u .
consensus exist about this among the main polit forc .
madam presid , i want to make two point .
first , on valu .
the european union is a union of valu .
these valu are criterion for access .
they guid u in our behaviour .
second , on institut .
i would like to hear someth from you on this subject .
do you not agre with me , mr solana ?
perhap he is not listen .
obvious i understand commission .
not much , apart from act a wit .
i would like to make three observ .
we know this is a veri import part .
is there progress in this area ?
is it enough ?
do the citizen valu this foreign polici ?
the answer is , again , yes ' .
the answer is no ' .
i have alreadi touch upon financ .
how doe this like-minded come about ?
the question of valu wa rais .
do we agre on valu ?
it get more ident .
this ha been veri controversi .
this is a veri real risk i can envisag .
this is a job for the next parliamentari term .
this hous , and the eu , are testimoni to that .
we have to learn from our mistak .
that is a nobl caus .
yes , we are pacifist .
who is not a pacifist ?
anybodi of sound mind is a pacifist .
who want suffer ; who want war ?
but we must have the mean to prevent it .
we must be proactiv .
let me make one last comment .
the debat is close .
the vote will take place on thursday , 19 februari 2009 .
written statement ( rule 142 )

region econom integr is crucial in this regard .
for sever reason .

this is how crucial it is .
we have had some veri ambiti object in the mediterranean .

this fragment make visibl suffer .
the other impedi is the middl east problem .
we have done a lot on this issu .
the union wa born with mistak , but at least it exist .
i therefor give it the benefit of my support .
the question rais concern how we can pursu this strategi .
can this new partnership bear fruit ?
mr napoletano 's report goe against this percept .
there must be a clear strategi .
the list of speaker ha been exhaust .
my countri ha an interest in the mediterranean .
i think we have observ status too .
the challeng are absolut enorm .
do we have the resourc to confront them ?
we know that we do not .
you have prepar a realli interest document .
where are we now ?
so we know whi we are do this and what we want to achiev .
we just need to move .
so i think we are readi .
thank you veri much for a use debat .
we are certain readi to assist you further .
all the acqui is there then .
we have work a great deal on that .
do not worri then .
fortun , everyth is there .

one-minut speech on matter of polit import
how should we treat such leader ?
( bg ) the european econom recoveri plan is now in place .
the crisi is follow differ path in differ countri .
this decis ha onli deepen the european crisi .
it ha blame the effect of the crisi .
the no ' vote ha also drop six point to 33 % .
this synod can not be regist and ha no legal basi .
this wa the paradox that i want to share with you .
dure it cours , ten of million of peopl met their death .
a lead forc in this is the german press .
this is what local autonomi mean .
this also appli to the hungarian minor in romania .
this is a de facto and de jure situat .
protection is like a dose of cocain for an economi .
this is an unaccept situat for two reason .
the problem we face are european .
the treati of lisbon ha been mention repeat today .
howev , last week 6 state block the commiss 's propos .
that conclud the item .
i think that this is a piti , and that it is a bad habit .
and i think that the presid should react to this situat .
therefor , we need chang in neighbourhood polici .
this will signific facilit vote tomorrow .
the innov cross-bord cooper compon ha been success launch .
we have also target project to strengthen the judiciari .
howev , let u be honest .
i think that is realli true .
third , i see that the report call for more resourc .
clear , more resourc improv our leverag - that is true .
i am delight that this ha also been approv in the report .
that should not happen .
the second amend deal with the energi issu .
we must answer this question .
appropri amount should be set asid for this .
let u activ use these opportun .
ultim , it amount to a question of credibl of eu polici .
i ask the commiss to take this concern into consider .
ukrain may serv a an exampl .
the main point can be sum up by just one word : ambit .
i will give him the floor after the catch-the-ey ' period .
it is a democrat deficit that stem from their histori .
we must set a real exampl .
let me just say a few thing .
i am , of cours , veri thank for mani of the suggest .
so , a you can see , we are near at the same level .
time is against u .
the debat is close .
the vote will take place tomorrow .
written statement ( rule 142 )
new financ discus will begin this year .
with a littl bit of creativ , there are other sourc .
the review is about the implement of the instrument .
the two exercis are differ , but they are complementari .
what are these non-oda activ ?
we recognis that there is a problem with non-oda activ .
final , i see that the report call for more resourc .
we will have to look into it .
we will examin this a part of the review .
there is fund for 2009 , but not beyond that .
this should allow an adjust of the differ head ' ceil .
it exclud militari aid but it doe not exclud peacekeep .
given the design of the dci , the legisl gap wa inevit .
let u just call a spade a spade .
we veri much hope that the amend will be withdrawn . '
the difficulti is that we are not .
howev , i remain to be convinc .
so let u work togeth in order to find the right solut .
it is a bit hazard .

this propos must therefor be reject .
my question are a follow .

this may also prevent a brain drain in europ .
i trust , therefor , that the eri will improv this situat .
i think we all understand how import it is that we talk .
on the cost of patent applic , it is veri strike .
i think there is no simpl answer .
that is realli the onli way ahead .
i am , howev , quit optimist .
concern vat , i would like to be precis .
we do not propos vat exempt in the legisl .
in essenc , that is the stori .

first , the emphasi on lawmak .
the budget procedur will be quit difficult this year .
this is , of cours , elect year .
will it be possibl to sustain this level in 2010 ?
i hope so .
this will be our greatest challeng next year .
the differ in magnitud is absurd .
in these area , too , the eu 's budget is thorough neglig .
the same appli to energi polici .
gas pipelin are cheaper to lay on land than on the seab .
it is a new rapallo , and the eu doe not say a word .
what is lack is consensus , and also dialogu .
we should also attempt to come to decis togeth .
this concern energi suppli and energi secur .
henc the question : is this realli what we want ?
my second question is a follow .
if we do support compani , whi nabucco ?
whi do we want to creat imbal in this regard ?
what is your justif for this ?
my third point is that the money must be spent in europ .
what is the use of our invest in azerbaijan ?
they expect u to provid assist .
there is fund in place for onli 2 % of major project .
how is that possibl ?
there are also some small matter in this hous .
we have a budget of eur 1.5 billion .
we have a great deal more work ahead of u in this regard .
they should be noth veri grand .
i want to focus on one detail in my speech .
this budget point beyond itself .
today there is someth el at stake .
we need the union .
thank you for your respect attent .
i would like onc again to thank all of my colleagu .

the debat is close .
the vote will take place on tuesday , 10 march 2009 .
written statement ( rule 142 )
particular attent must be given to north-south network .
the next item is the joint debat on :
i wish to say a few word about the background .
i believ that such a propos wa long overdu .
the stori is similar to that of the european compani .
my sincer thank for your attent .
for that sourc continu to be credit .
the other challeng is to creat european solidar .
we are now realli in a critic phase .
this is the veri lifelin of the european economi .
we are grate for your support .
let me turn now to mr lehn 's two report .
it is design for smes .
the commiss , therefor , welcom the adopt of this report .
these reason are still valid .
court of justic case-law clear allow for compani mobil .
it is too earli to ass it full applic .
it is in this regard that new ground need to be broken .
final , i would like to say that
small is beauti .
on no account must exist right be curtail .
employe ' right are core right for a social europ .
bureaucraci must be nip in the bud .
we must act quick to take advantag of this potenti .
smes also play a crucial role in overcom the crisi .
we need to act quick on this .
these initi were appreci but inadequ .
whi do i say inadequ ?
this ha not been done .
we now ask for it to be done immedi afterward .
we found a veri good compromis with the rapporteur .
i will take two exampl .
that is includ in point 87 regard the cohes fund .
second exampl : red tape .
such nobl intent are onli to be applaud .
first , take the size of the target enterpris .
it amount to a revamp bolkestein .
this ha been the task of the committe on legal affair .
what is need now is a rethink .
we must press the larg reset button , a it were .
i should like to congratul mr herczog on this report .
madam presid , i too would like to welcom this report .
that is absolut essenti for all of u .
that is whi we shall vote against this regul .
that is my greatest concern .
there is no reason for this cours of action .
labour right must not be violat .
we can not allow social standard to slip .
we must therefor promot better social awar of smes .
they constant encount a rang of obstacl .
noth could be further from the truth .
howev , i consid this to be a fals alarm .
howev , i have two reserv .
mentorship is particular import in encourag such activ .
i would just like to comment on one point .
i share the view that mr becsey ha just express .

howev , those studi are wrong on three count .
his absenc is due to prepar for that .
i wish to respond to some of the point rais .
it is a process of mani issu around access to financ .
mr kara spoke on the small busi act ( sba ) .
i see mani friend of smes here .
europ could be more innov and creativ in support smes .
this benefit no one but lawyer .
my second point concern particip .
it is practic onli abus that are be record .
some colleagu ask whi it is not legal bind .
it is not legal bind by natur for mani reason .
thank you veri much for your support .
the vote will take place on thursday .
written statement ( rule 142 )
i would just like to highlight two absolut essenti aspect .
this statut would also offer smes greater flexibl .
the truth is specif .

in most other eu member state , the situat is even wors .
perhap the text that is final adopt will not be so bad .
in ani case , we should ask ourselv the question whi ' ?

in 2007 , the eu receiv more than 200 000 asylum applic .
the question of asylum is a veri delic one .
this develop is worri , to say the least .
whi , i ask myself .
we alreadi have intern convent that specifi this .
i find that unaccept .
yesterday wa intern woman 's day .

the harmonis of standard is definit worthi of support .

written statement ( rule 142 )
i am not a support but rather an oppon of internet gambl .
a for geograph inform , the commiss share your view .
the procedur should be simplifi or , at least , speed up .
the question of an agenc remain open .
that conclud this item .
the vote will take place tomorrow .
written statement ( rule 142 )
but simplifi standard doe not mean le qualiti or authent .
the same can not alway be said of import good .
this will mislead the consum .
the ideal solut would be to use physic mean .
on the other hand , the whole area of train judg is vital .
what could we do to help them to achiev this ?
i think the task is quit a difficult one .
that is true .
i want to carri on and briefli examin the outlook .
such wa the regul .

this will play a part in that regard .
this regul will make european car safer .
that is , therefor , a realli veri noteworthi contribut .
thank you veri much .
this must also uncondit appli to tyre safeti .
we therefor have to see safeti in anoth light here , too .
i would like to highlight two point .
her car wa destroy , but she walk away relat unhurt .
that is the context in which we are discus this report .
i believ that to be a major flaw .
this wa an import area of strengthen .
the point about safeti ha been well made .
the committe wa clear with regard to nois and health .
we must welcom anyth which make road safer .
overal , we have achiev a good compromis .
madam presid , i want to rais a relat matter .
can the commission plea comment ?
one part of these addit measur ha now been regul .
the debat is close .
the vote will take place today at 12 noon .
written statement ( rule 142 )
we are therefor help a competit car industri .
new technolog will enabl u to have safer , greener car .
that - and i will put this somewhat care - is an exagger .
those are the european environ agenc 's figur .
this techniqu is not scienc fiction .
the same appli to inspect by the author .
where there may be danger , a closer look should be taken .
where noth happen , there is no need for constant monitor .
for mani in this chamber , soil protect is a sore point .
it would be better left to the member state .
ippc affect almost all sector of industri .
a farmer 's field is no industri plant .
this wa about keep thing in proport .
such an approach is not construct .
plea support the compromis !
thank you .
this unaccept situat must stop .
that is the object of the commiss propos .
provis is made to appli them in 2016 .
the benefit of this simplif are numer .
the system of control and test ha becom too diver .
a mr krahmer said , it need to be amend .
person , i am prepar to see a trade-off .
what are we do here ?
that is exact where we have to go .
you have negoti all these compromis with u in a good way .
i think this is a shame .
i myself work on the soil protect direct .
this is an import direct and i hope it will be adopt .
al gore ha left a clear mark .
i have tabl a coupl of supplementari amend , therefor .
recent case law ha shown this not to be the case .
the legisl is in need of repair , therefor .
in germani , we call this kind of nitpick count pea ' .
soil protect is import .
there must be effici nation law to deal with it .
it repres a good compromis .
( sv ) mr presid , this is a veri import piec of legisl .
this direct is not the place to regul small farm .
peopl have enough to blame the eu for without that !
we can not have compromis that prevent discus .
so far , so good .
this remov the cost incent to reduc co2 .
we have to be consist .
plea convinc me otherwis .
i do not think this is a good idea .
it implement will get u where we need to go .
permit condit are alreadi general veri stringent .
i am plea that the amend tabl by my group clear this up .
this is disproportion and therefor not sensibl .
mr presid , i will stick specif to agricultur .
we alreadi know that agricultur is under huge pressur .
plea reconsid the amend which are particular damag to it .
mr presid , i want to keep this short .
to conclud , i just have a coupl more thing to say .
i have a lot of sympathi for that .
this is someth that we can talk about .
the problem is that that is exact what we have not done .
the debat is close .
the vote will take place on tuesday , 10 march 2009 .
written statement ( rule 142 )
take our amend 44 on classifi document .
so the link is alreadi there .
that will not happen and can not happen under my report .
for this reason , a complet overhaul is not necessari .
have said this , even a good tool can alway be improv .
we need to lead by exampl .
mr presid , transpar is the basi of democraci .
direct need to be chang , but so do attitud .
attitud , therefor , have to chang .
we should have electron vote ...
( the presid cut off the speaker )
togeth , we have push the current transpar legisl through .
transpar is an import part of democraci .
will the ppe-d group lose the three minut , or what ?
i do not know what to say .
first of all , it is take realiti into consider .
this is complet unaccept .
you do know what should realli be done .
we are not get through , and new snow keep on come .
rather , such peopl are often just peopl who ask question .
ask question like this is allow .
all mep must also bear respons for the way they vote .
this is alreadi in evid a thing stand .
we will clarifi the final posit of our group tonight .
we do all agre on the object .
is that what you want ?
the principl of democraci demand it .
access document is also a question of find them .
they thought i wa the commission - perish the thought !
i rest my case .
is this post-it note a document , for exampl ?
sometim it is not help to make a definit too broad .
so we clarifi and help with the definit of document .
what about the record of polit group meet or prepar ?
we becom more vulner .
commission , it is offici document which are access .
go back and look at the report . the space to think .
go back to the report .
accept our principl .

( sustain applaus )
( applaus )
thank you , mr zaleski - the applaus speak for itself .
explan of vote
oral explan of vote
instead , we are do precis the opposit .
it is for that reason that i vote against the report .
pactio olisipiensi censenda est !
mr presid , i shall be brief .
i have an addit point .
we have concern in ireland about road safeti issu .
this mean competit on an equal foot throughout europ .
regul on soil protect have no cross-bord effect .
soil protect is not a cross-bord issu .
mr presid , i vote against his report .
it must be reject .
that should be the respons of the nation govern .
i can not accept that .
howev , when it come to recast , we have a difficulti .
mayb we should , a ha been suggest by one of our colleagu .
i recent met with some produc in my constitu .
( nl ) mr presid , i vote against this report .
the answer is : veri littl .
howev , this doe not mean that we must turn to protection .
so i ask my pension .
he told me : oh , onlin gambl , i have lost eur 10 000 ' .
a littl later i met a retir ladi , lucia annon .
ala , this is obvious not that place .
mr presid , we all know that gambl is a veri emot subject .
howev , consid the hypocrisi of this report .
let u be honest in this debat a to what it is all about .
but it product requir a fair and competit return .
we see similar packag in america .
this is what it seem to have come down to .
all this we know .
( sk ) mr presid , i vote for mr herczog 's report .
we have 23 million smes in the european union .
smes are dynam and have a great abil to innov and develop .
99.2 % of my region 's busi employ fewer than 49 peopl .
this initi can curb unemploy and restart our economi .
let u have some action .
i am sure it give you much le pleasur than it give u .
it is that sort of attitud that we need to tackl .
written explan of vote
such a rare event deserv to be highlight .
this level of schizophrenia is quit beyond u .
this is what the u experi show , in ani case .
the use of person data is benefici to public safeti .
mr presid , i support giusto catani 's report .
this is a joint respons .
legend die hard .
we have support this report today on that basi .
thank you , mr presid , i vote in favour of the report .
we have therefor vote in favour of this report .
howev , this is a yes ' vote with a clear proviso .
we do not have suffici nurseri and crèches .
green drive ' mean reduc fuel consumpt .
we can not support such a propos .
in write . - we strong support the origin ippc direct .
minimum requir .
poultri and manur and slurri .
i also vote in favour of flexibl for instal
how is circumvent of use nation legisl to be prevent ?
how doe the propos accord with consum protect ?
no satisfactori answer are provid to such question .
the aim is laudabl .
it is a reform that is definit need .
the commiss 's propos is veri poor .
i have therefor chosen to vote against it .
we would like to issu the follow explan , howev .
the process is not yet over .
new firm mean new workplac , and henc econom recoveri .
it will provid an attract altern to nation regul .
sector that have perform poor must also be subsidis .
this is not a necessari cost given the current situat .
onlin gambl is enjoy by mani european citizen .
in write . - i support a more open game environ in europ .
consum protect is vital import to all the member state .
mani peopl in the european union enjoy onlin gambl .
we must ensur that these peopl are safe from harm on line .
these system should not be made uniform or merg into one .
the promot of specif european agricultur and food product .
ultim , consum have to be abl to reli on label .
that is unaccept .
this foster obvious inequ in term of competit .
this is neoliber in it most visibl form .
howev , i have some comment to make .
they account for almost 99 % of all enterpris in the eu .
that is someth which i can not and do not support .
it is , rather , a tragedi .
correct to vote and vote intent : see minut
approv of the minut of the previous sit : see minut
the next item is the joint debat on :
last , i will move on to my own report .
this measur target hulk .
parliament play it part back then .
in my opinion , all this form a success whole .
thus , we have provid a balanc packag .
we have spent 10 year work on this , then .
this time , we are do so without the pressur of a disast .
i should like to express my warm thank to him posthum .
until recent , it wa manag through various set of regul .
yet it is clear that it wa necessari .
i would like to thank mr tajani and the commiss .
that , ladi and gentleman , is whi we have succeed .
( applaus )
the negoti process wa difficult .
at the time of first read , parliament adopt some amend .
my own propos and that of mr savari remain to be agre .
my particip in this process wa a great honour .
they are capabl of send out a messag to guarante safeti .
other devic will be appli to the port state .
so i believ that this is our common goal .
that is someth we should say in the elect campaign , too .
let me make two more point , howev .
we should give him particular credit for that .
mr vice-presid , all eye are on you , now !
we should be fight togeth to achiev that .
thank you veri much .
that is whi cross-bord action is urgent requir .
this wa not heed .
these report have been modifi , but not for the better .
in fact , there is now contradict between them .
i will tri again .
these report need a real overhaul .
final , the fernand report endors various imo recommend .
how democrat is that ?
thank you , mr ortuondo larrea .
in other word , the mountain ha brought forth a mous .
i therefor vote for the set of report .
the rapporteur ha done an excel job in this regard .
what we have now is more transpar and stricter inspect .
( ro ) the third maritim packag is extrem import .
howev , i would like , if i may , to draw attent to ...
( the presid cut off the speaker )
comment plea , commission .
will the commiss be abl to ensur they are compli with ?
it wa our duti , and we did not need to wait for anyon .
if their qualiti is below par , you must take action .
all the best , then .
so much for the correct .
fortun , some of the rule will immedi come into forc .
i also thank everyon for your comment and contribut .
the debat is close .
the vote will take place tomorrow .
written statement ( rule 142 )
no one ha yet been made to answer for this .
the next item is the joint debat on the follow report :
i wish to add straight away that this is no miracl cure .
we therefor have to do someth .
i should also like to thank everyon involv .
it wa not easi ; point of view differ veri wide .
what are the essenti point ?
first , which extern are to be introduc into the system ?
we opt for the area of air pollut , nois and congest .
this is option , not obligatori .
this must be the ultim object .
overal , the impact of all of this is actual limit .
no one on earth could understand that .
you know , it is the same stori with the eurovignett .
congest , though ?
there is no point in that .
what are you actual propos ?
you say there are mani option .
no , you are the commiss !
so help u do this - propos someth realli tangibl !
henc my puzzlement .
the report is clear critic .
thank you , mr tajani .
let u not deceiv ourselv .
the second aspect relat to technolog and export .
no european charg are to be impos .
we are staunch support of invest in sustain transport .
amend of the agenda
the cost incur by traffic congest are rise to 1 % of gdp .
this is an essenti compon of parliament 's posit .
if this doe not happen , we no longer have a compromis .
thank you .
the burden are well enough known to all of u .
the govern ha creat a den network of ever wider motorway .
decis taken on this in 2006 have yield insuffici result .
europ must not repeat such error by member state .
amend 40 will therefor have to be remov from the report .
this is essenti to my support for the eurovignett direct .
in addit , this propos must not remain isol .
the imposit of such regulatori charg is a nation compet .
we , the commiss and parliament , want to do that .
we have also kept a sen of proport .
design should take preced here , not ban .
tomorrow , this item will be vote on again a amend 40 .
the rapporteur is in favour .
mr presid , i will speak on the el khadraoui report .
at least three factor are simultan at play .
the present eurovignett appli the user pay ' principl .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
they are hit while go to the market .
and what is this about it be a singl market ?
it is not !
you ca n't have it both way , howev .
everyon essenti agre to the principl of pay the true cost .
the 20-20-20 target will otherwis grow ever more distant .
this reinforc the pollut pay principl .
that is a social democrat concept .
nobodi will be forc to do so .
the sector drive ban in austria are a good exampl of this .
we have come a long way .
a few tricki point remain under discus , howev .
let u not make them pay for the upkeep of the countri .
the eu ha had a mandatori rail toll sinc the mid-1990 .
that is unfair competit .
that is just mad .
that is whi we need this direct .
we need the true reflect of cost .
then they will be credibl .
first , it ha come too soon .
this text contradict that in it partial .
they need to have a rang of tool at their dispos .
so much for hypothec .
a mr lichtenberg put it , there is document evid ' .
it is import for u to support this when we vote tomorrow .
he ha done a fine job .
he ha dealt with hundr of comment .
we must explain to them how this initi came about .
modal chang remain a dream and is far from becom realiti .
otherwis , we will alway have imbal in this regard .
thank you .
we do , in my view , need to be quit clear on this .
i therefor think that this will be a benefici text .
the question of job is a complet differ issu .
this direct , howev , ha absolut noth to do with that .
in ani case , the eurovignett is not compulsori .
the argument is therefor certain thorni and complic .
mr presid , i wish to make a coupl of comment .
with all due respect , that is complet wrong .
nois would add 1.1 euro cent to this .
for the rest of the rout , the 65 euro cent can be deduct .
we should not be deter by this one bit .
let u simpli go for a posit we support 100 % .
the first i address to mr evan .
we believ this is reason .
that , sure , can not be right !
you see , you said you do not want ani new tax .
that is not on .
thank you veri much .
question time ( commiss )
the follow question have been submit to the commiss .
the ecofin today came to a compromis .
is this someth that can be consid , and where are we head ?
if so , whi ?
the ecofin adopt it opinion on these report this morn .
( de ) mr presid , commission , i have two brief question .
my second question is a follow .
ha there been a chang in the rule of procedur ?
mr doyl , we will actual finish at 8 p.m. a intend .
we began late and we will finish late .
doe the honour member not have a supplementari question ?
do you wish to pose your supplementari question mr doyl ?
mr presid , i do .
my apolog .
i misunderstood the point you made .
subject : abolit of tax haven
they onli exist becaus the eu allow them to do so .
these are her word : 'a resolut polici against tax evas ' .
subject : the internet and hate crime
incit to racial hatr is a crime in all eu member state .
i know you have look into it in great detail .
the evid so far is that they are increas a we speak .

is it not time to be bold with the export refund ?
becaus , commission , our industri is die on it foot .
i complet agre on the three reason for the situat .
subject : label for sheep meat product
it is import .
thank you commission .
there seem to be unanim now in the council on this issu .
that conclud question time .
( the sit wa suspend at 8.05 p.m. and resum at 9 p.m . )
childcar facil - barcelona object ( debat )
the aim is to offer this option to parent who want it .
i think that is true .
( the presid ask the speaker to speak more slowli )
home childcar is import .
thank you ever so much .
far too littl attent is paid to this at present .
what el will the commiss do to encourag the member state ?
you have also hint that there are possibl of co-financ .
are these possibl be use by the member state ?
i would ask that you answer this question .
i think that , togeth , we should bear this in mind .
woman have been a wonder addit to the workforc .
they are hardwir to need what they need .
natur is a veri power forc .
there are alway consequ when we go against natur .
child are our futur .
the situat with childcar in slovakia is rather complic .
they are also a requir for the promot of equal .
end quot .
it is hard to believ when read it .
yet woman have the same right a men to profession fulfil .
in addit , the number of single-par famili is on the rise .
sometim , the famili environ is violent .
2. of good qualiti .
this is absolut not a meaningless question .
my countri , bulgaria , offer a high level of childcar .
will we then invest in the child of europ ?
it is an approach for this centuri .
in this case , i recommend the follow action :
1. increas the involv of nation govern in this problem ,
mani have spoken about the econom crisi .
we need , like never befor , to invest in our child .
i urg the commission to keep the pressur on .
child actual receiv human treatment .
( pl ) madam presid , nurseri are an evil .
they may be a necessari evil , but they are an evil .
they need both financi support and advic .
that is someth we must rememb .
it all sound so logic and modern , socialist , even .
nobodi want to send woman into the home .
there are even organis that seek to defend them !
it is that which our societi also need to do .

( applaus )
howev , my speech is an appeal .
we have avoid a meltdown of the financi system .
cross-bord bank hold up to 80 % of europ 's bank asset .
strengthen supervis is , therefor , import in itself .
import work is under way in that respect .
howev , we probabl need to go further .
of cours , deficit inevit swell in time of econom recess .
automat stabilis can , to some extent , play a posit role .
most will do so from 2010 .
this will also be an import messag from next week 's meet .
the financi crisi is now affect the real economi .
of cours , member state ' respons are differ .
which lead me to the g20 summit meet in london .
we want this summit to be ambiti .
we can not afford it to fail .
it mean take adequ measur to improv energi effici .
the commiss 's januari communic is a veri help basi .
( applaus )
it destroy job and test the resist of our social model .
it also put strong polit pressur on all the leader .
the european union is not immun from such tension .
we need greater coordin and wider-rang effect .
look at the financi system .
yes , we need immedi action to address immedi problem .
howev , we must also revamp supervis .
just look at energi secur .
this is central to what we are do .
the money ha to come , essenti , from nation budget .
this requir determin and imagin .
we need to use this time well .
we will also carri more weight on the global stage .
they are base around the same principl .
unfortun , it is far from over .
the problem at the moment is the lack of abil to act .
they must , therefor , be integr into the discus .
i think that we have done too littl , too late .
what should we do , then ?
we know veri well what .
we have talk about lifelong learn .
now we come to the social consequ .
you have mention them and they are particular import .
the public sector is doubli import .
i would also like to say someth about young peopl .
young peopl are current becom unemploy straight from educ .
otherwis , we are store up problem for the futur .
in conclus , we must act .
( applaus )
thank you , mr presid , mr vondra and mr barroso .
second , the cohes polici and solidar polici .
we believ that the unus margin should not be use .
social cohes mean be integr into the labour market .
europ is oblig to innov if it is to surviv globalis .
it must not be a routin summit .
howev , a strong europ must not be a protectionist europ .
this prevent u from engag in demagogi and popul .
this oblig u to speak honest to the peopl of europ .
( applaus )
( applaus )
we have heard mani of the old familiar phrase be repeat .
it is realli wonder and it all sound excel .
howev , now we actual need to deliv someth .
we must make the necessari decis .
more must be done in the european council .
the crisi is deepen and job are be lost .
this mean that peopl 's livelihood are be destroy .
this mean that job are be lost .
this mean that compani are be threaten with closur .
you must do more !
mr barroso , you have made a wonder speech .
it wa excel and we support it fulli .
solidar between the member state is urgent need .
these initi are urgent need .
it is wonder .
you seem sudden to have woken up .
( applaus )
and their under messag is this : job , job , job .
so recess must not mean inact .
if differ persist , it will not do .
europ can fight fire no longer .
it is a vicious circl .
mr barroso , noth wa done in respons to this request .
everi year , we hear mani comfort assur on this subject .
they are simpli more of the same .
despit all of the measur adopt to date , unemploy is rise .
i am not the onli one who think that someth is wrong .
europ must take a differ rout .
i want to call that into question .
we do not have the money .
he ha lost his marbl !
this is one of the histor fact in this area .
unfortun , that is the case .
we should not discus this until we are blue in the face .
( applaus )
plea do not paint too rosi a pictur of europ . '
howev , that is exact what you are do .
we are come with le than half .
how could you imagin respect for the european union ?
if we do not do that , we will lose .
my final point concern solidar .
let u show solidar in real term .
there are plenti of option .
this is precis what is need to recov from a recess .
if not , the eu will lose it credibl .
we therefor urgent need a boost from europ .
what are we see again today , though ?
mr daul is quit correct .
now is the time for u to show solidar and innov .
we therefor need innov in two area .
what we need is exact the opposit .
it is the onli way of bring this disastr crisi to an end .
we did not have these thing , howev .
the imbal are therefor huge .
the lisbon strategi is a good idea that ha been botch .
the euro is a bad idea that ha exacerb the problem .
is it a case of european solidar or support for the state ?
this appli to all the region across all the member state .
mr presid , i would like to start by respond to mr farag .
could we have a better target ?
could we have a better deliveri ?
we need to mobilis actor to act .

let u act togeth .
there must be penalti for ineffici use .

( interject from the floor )
that wa an agreement between you and me , wa it not ?
mr presid , what we need now is stabil .
that is the way we can achiev more job .
( nl ) mr presid , this crisi is a test for europ .
europ is not the sum total of 27 time the nation interest .
it is now or never for europ .

this , of cours , is not by chanc .
the socialist posit is much more complex .
europ must not let them down .
the role of the eib must be strengthen .
europ must act to defin a clear , innov econom strategi .
econom oper need prospect and legal stabil .
let u invest in our ten transport network .
do noth and let the market decid ha fail .
we want to act and we want to act decis .
let u follow it with courag .
in europ , we agre to the so-cal stabil and growth pact .

we intend to address that issu at next week 's meet .
it is a key part of the lisbon strategi .
graham watson ask how much we will have to pay .
i think that is prematur .
howev , it would be prematur to give an estim now .
i am sorri for onc to have to contradict mr juncker .
at the moment , we do not even know that .
we must take the appropri polit measur in this respect .
howev , one thing is clear .
this transform must continu dure the crisi .
the financi measur that we take must support these object .
this mean that we must help them to obtain fund .
howev , it ha now reach the limit of what it can do .
what will parliament therefor ask of the commiss ?
howev , what is parliament ask of the council ?

it is not worth tri to rank grievanc .

the ghost of protection doe not offer good advic !
we must make effect use of everi opportun avail to u .

we were discus this a year ago .
i shall limit myself to these few conclud remark .
i said a lot at the begin .
now we will move on .
your support ha been much appreci .
it is not , a mr vondra said , a polit problem .
that , then , is the commit : eur 68 million .
the inform technolog , howev , ha to be in place .
the debat is close .
written statement ( rule 142 )
the next item is the council and the commiss statement on :
croatia : progress report 2008 ,
turkey : progress report 2008 , and
let me begin with croatia .
the presid will continu to take forward the negoti .
we had a lunch just befor the sit to discus this in depth .
that said , despit good progress , much remain to be done .
work on ensur the sustain of refuge return must continu .
this also goe for legisl to improv the right of minor .
effort to improv good neighbour relat must continu .
let me now turn to the issu of turkey .
further work on the polit criterion remain key .
a comprehens anti-corrupt strategi need to be develop .
it is a dynam countri with consider potenti .
at the same time , it face a number of signific challeng .
both these point are brought out admir in your report .
we shall see whether these effort bear fruit .
the commiss 's 2008 progress report is help .
person , i hope that posit develop can be achiev soon .
further progress in this direct is achiev .
let me start with croatia .
we agre to continu the talk in the near futur .
henc , this is still work in progress .
i shall say a few word on cyprus .
croatia ha made progress in a number of area .
i have sent you the document and you have fail to respond .
we are in a difficult situat .
it is clear that movement is need on both side .
the word of your origin propos wa not ideal .
the key issu of the debat is how we can make progress .
we will make progress .
the two side must agre to move in this direct .
they must remain outsid the framework .
i hope that we will then achiev posit result .
this is not about open chapter .
mr presid , more must be done in those area .
onli then can polit chapter be open .
this , too , ha been includ in the report .
i should like to make a few more point , mr presid .
this need to chang .
this need to chang .
i wa present at the elect and they were exemplari .
there were difficulti with a tini minor within the minor .
the border problem is exact the same a when slovenia join .
i would in ani case like this word to ... .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
freedom of speech must be guarante .
we are still not happi with what is happen over there .
i should like to finish off with one last remark .
for this to happen , howev , further effort are necessari .
this is veri import .
it is still possibl that we can keep to the origin timet .
this is our joint respons .
that is how i understand the turkish statement on nabucco .
we need a more pragmat approach here .
the temptat of blackmail is a bad counsellor .
the stabil of this region is still fragil .
in that respect , all credit to the rapporteur .
this wa not the case , unfortun .
the will to reform from 2004 will need to return .
then , and onli then , can we talk about their access .
this ha not happen .
the main problem is the matter of the name .
we see this veri clear .
mr presid , thank you for clarifi that .
let u resolv this outstand issu prompt and sensibl .
howev , what we see is someth el .
critic journalist have difficulti obtain credenti .
the rule of law must also be guarante .
i should like if i may to say someth el about this debat .
i think we should restructur this debat , and soon .
that show how far behind we are .
turkey is asia , not europ .
i ask everyon to resist that .
let u therefor pull the plug .
the remain reform in the judiciari refer to are be tackl .
commission , you sudden refer to european border disput ' .
the candid countri macedonia ha also made huge progress .
( c ) i would like to make a few comment .
we must maintain our focus on this prioriti .
( sl ) we in the ald group support mr meier 's report .
erect more 10 m tall monument is unnecessari .
abolish visa doe not go far enough .
what this countri need is a date for the begin of negoti .
in fact , you could say that time is money .
allow me also to say a few word about croatia .
discrimin against ethnic and religi minor continu .
domest violenc and forc marriag continu to be common .
this is a scandal .
( de ) thank you , madam presid .
we have to stop the hypocrisi and the pretenc .
we must rememb one obvious fact .
turkey is a countri in asia minor .
the peopl of europ do not want turkey in europ .
let u respect our peopl and show respect for europ !
around 100 of these were success achiev .
this is also reflect in this report .
these are major reform .
how are they and their child look after ?
turkey should address this issu .

i would like to see this happen a soon a possibl .
third , make progress on the cyprus question .
( bg ) thank you , madam presid .

the debat is close .

promot diversif is most urgent in the area of gas suppli .
quit the revers .
onli two of 161 indicte remain at larg .

these are updat on a regular basi .
these common posit are regular extend and updat .
war crimin should not be exempt from punish .
this appli to all countri from which suspect hail .
we would not be credibl if we did not hold firm to this .
this is , after all , one of the copenhagen criterion .
i would like to make two point .
the socialist group ha propos two amend to plenari .
that ha led to confus and a consist postpon of deadlin .
we can not afford to relax these condit .
this is someth that is also stress in mr neyt 's report .
the tribun 's work must be fulli complet .

written statement ( rule 142 )

at the same time , a lot of public explan lie ahead .
subject : road safeti
what plan doe the presid have to tackl this issu ?
( ro ) the eu ha not done enough to reduc road accid .
the european parliament ha vote for this .
we want to move the debat forward .
green paper on the european workforc for health ( debat )
i refer to direct 2005/36/ec , which is now in forc .
if i may say so , i think that is half the question .
the other half is whi so mani are leav .
we have to see how promot is seen a a potenti .
we have to ensur that the work environ is pleasant .
it is go to be tough but it can be comfort a well .
this one is somewhat behind .
it concern the health profession .
she ha refer to the recognit of qualif .
i think that is someth we need to look at more .
the commission right refer to the brain drain .
therefor , they do not go back to work there .
all those thing are import , commission .
we need to look at the safeti of health profession .
this is , of cours , imposs .
in each case , peopl and well-intend interest are involv .
this is unheard of , of cours .
health is a social valu , not a commerci commod .
howev , in some countri , this is not the problem .
commission , it is not a question of attract young peopl .
it is a question of allow them to train .
this sector is veri import .
we need them more everi year , not le .
final , our health forc is more import than ever .
howev , we feel this most acut in our own back yard .
a direct on this matter is essenti .
commission , thank you for your green paper .
we can not allow doctor to be on duti for too long .
that is the other side of the coin .
the debat is close .
the situat is serious , a you know .
water shortag have spread beyond the tradit arid area .
the un figur speak for themselv .
this goal can be achiev onli if we all contribut to it .
it ha also improv water govern and manag in acp countri .
member state are invit to particip with addit fund .
howev , the problem is vast .
i have here with me a unicef brochur which date from 2001 .
what doe it tell u ?
the charter state :
that access to water ha an enorm influenc on develop ' ;
we need to reach a real turn point on the water issu .
appropri financ will then , of cours , be requir .
we use larg amount of water everi day .
this mean that one child die everi 15 second .
this lead to arm conflict , migrat and destabilis .
politician will also be present at the forum we are debat .
they will discus matter of current import .
take the exampl of water a a fundament human right .
a right can not be bought or sold in a free societi .
a right is onli bought in a societi of slave .
so what will europ say at istanbul ?
that is a prime exampl of ambigu word .
what doe this phrase realli mean ?
this is absolut inadmiss and unaccept .
all that is fundament import for this water forum .
the commiss will continu to assist these countri .
we realli have to take action about that .
the debat is close .
the vote will take place on thursday , 12 march 2009 .
i would like to make four point .
first , the budget for healthcar must be increas .
third , expertis must be enhanc .

here are just two exampl .
the first is leadership by partner govern .

implement of the singl euro payment area ( sepa ) ( debat )
we now realis that these question were probabl justifi .
we think it is undoubt time to do so .
mastercard is appeal the commiss 's decis .
discus with visa are ongo a well .
in the commiss 's opinion , this should not happen .
here , clear communic by bank will be import .
these fee should not be abolish .
payment servic are a commerci activ .
on the other hand , opac or arbitrari should be avoid .
obvious , we hope that they will be taken into consider .
i think that the sepa would be a good instrument here .
let me , howev , recal three import point .
we will relentless continu our effort a a sepa catalyst .
the debat is close .
the vote will take place tomorrow , 12 march 2009 .
sri lanka ( debat )
these peopl are endur realli terribl suffer .
what is meant by evacu ' , though ?
where are these peopl go to go ?
this is also what india suggest last weekend .
there can not be ani impun for such crime .
an inclus dialogu is requir , lead to a polit settlement .
then i turn my attent to amend 3 , 4 and 5 .
i doubt that anyon would suggest that this is fabric .
i do not believ that he would be fabric .
i have some pictur of the camp .
again , i suggest they are genuin and not fabric .
i therefor genuin call upon you , plea , to act wise .
we know that .
war never resolv anyth .
can we allow ourselv to leav peopl to be evacu ?
tamil peopl are peopl who own land .
therefor , they want to return to their land .
they are sri lankan .
the game is up ; they can not carri on like this .
i think we should prepar for post-war order .
it founder quit simpli on the communic strategi .
our focus must be on the peopl themselv .
mr presid , this is not a point of order .
i want to thank mr meijer for his remark .
there is much evid .
it is not circumstanti .
ladi and gentleman , i strict appli the rule of procedur .

eastern partnership ( debat )
the eastern partnership is a key tool to accomplish that .
nevertheless , i welcom the recent thaw in relat .
we are lag behind the u . that is terribl .
the same appli to georgia and to all other countri .
consequ , we consid this of extrem import .
thank you .
i would appeal for caution in the case of belarus .
we have the necessari instrument avail to u today .
i hope it will be approv in march by the euroepan council .
energi secur , a wa said , is a key issu .
thank you .
what is done is done .
there should be no cart blanch for the lukashenko regim .
belarus ha littl in common with , say , georgia .
in other word , we are deal with a common neighbourhood .
i would like to stress one more principl .
what then , is , left for the black sea synergi to achiev ?
each of these countri is face with a choic .
they can follow either the russian or the european model .
the european communiti can certain offer them more .
we should aim to relax visa restrict .
extern energi secur polici is vital .
mr presid , catch-the-ey is a good opportun for polem .
i disagre with my colleagu mr severin .
let me say at the outset that it is base on valu .
it give support for both polit and econom reform .
that is my first comment .
a lot can be said about this eastern partnership .
the answer is quit a lot ' !
there is an outreach - a greater offer .
it is a young polici and one ha to give it a chanc .
we can not implement a strategi in just one year .
that is crucial .
i am veri grate to mr saryusz-wolski for his support .
i have alway been in favour of that .
therefor , we have to design .
it is a princip question .
we have to bring that togeth .
that conclud this item .
europ should decid continu support them .
the eastern partnership is a project for mani year .
this move encourag hope .
this effort can bring tangibl polit and econom benefit .
the next item is the joint debat on the follow report :
brazil is also a countri of decis import to mercosur .
migrat is one basic issu on the european polit agenda .
the foundat of our relationship are extrem solid .
we must absolut , therefor , help mexico .
we would like to complet the negoti on two major aspect .
i hope such a summit may be held with mexico this year .
bilater , there is ampl potenti for the relat to grow .
for europ it is veri benefici .
there are other risk , howev , which we must not forget .
that , despit the posit point , lead u to abstain .
in itself , this doe not troubl me much .
these partnership often function sole a a forum .
the question of tangibl result is frequent left unansw .
the union is choos the wrong prioriti here .
with this point , i shall wind up my speech .
we have to go further .
more ambit is need , both for europ and for latin america .
we have to set a target : for exampl , 2025 .
that would mean an automat cultur visa .
it promot free competit in the area of air servic .
this is key to communic ; this is key to do busi .
thank you for your attent .
it is good that we are also conclud bilater agreement .
( the presid cut off the speaker )

mr weber rais the question of inequ .
the debat is close .
the vote will take place today at 12 noon .
madam presid , i share your hope .
that is the line taken by beij .
this memorandum ha been publish and contain their demand .
there are two conflict posit : one of the parti is lie .
the eu can be decis in the search for the truth .
howev , it must take place on a differ basi .
we need to act .
we are be call on at home to enter into dialogu .
the eu polici vis-à-vi china is one of engag .
tibet is one of them .
i am think of a paragraph on cultur , educ and religion .
let me conclud by share with you a person convict .
it is a principl that ha serv u well .
diver is suppress , rather than embrac .
ever sinc then , tibet ha been under the control of beij .
in do this , we do not seek to provok or antagonis china .
the reason wa proport .
frank , it is becom counterproduct .
whi is it necessari to revisit the issu again ?
there is noth new in the resolut .
( protest )
he will be 20 this year .
a year ago , the violenc escal onc again .
we still have no news of possibl riot .
what is the respons to this show of power ?
silenc in the medium .
his call for dialogu ha had no posit respons in beij .
he said , we must build a great wall against separat ' .
this is the bitter realiti .
two day ago , the european parliament display flag .
there were peac protest in all part of the eu .
the memorandum must form the basi for further negoti .
we must have an answer to 600 imprison tibetan .
it must face up to this discus .
sad , it wa short-liv .
what is more , the govern also block websit .
i saw then how much the inhabit of tibet need help .
these guarante came to noth .
we do not want dialogu , we want negoti .
i think this is a veri reson reason .
the debat is close .
the vote will take place today at 12 noon .

commiss statement
therefor , it is import to be concern about cosmet .
we still have much to do in that area .
yet , i find that the critic often tend to stop short .
they assum we are alway static .
and we have a direct turn into a regul .
will they stand up and say , we were wrong ' ?
i do not think they will do ani of these thing .
we have made progress on all these area .
we are make histori with this vote .
now , it ha clear state that we do inde need specif regul .
the same general also appli in the field of nanotechnolog .
in fact , we still do not know veri much about it .
the answer , of cours , is no .
more knowledg and inform must be obtain on nanomateri .
it is a step in the right direct .
- ( sk ) i would like to thank the rapporteur .
it is a high import document for protect consum health .
we have taken the first step with this regul .
congratul , commission .
the use of nanomateri ha forc u to address the issu again .
it work on one person , but doe not work on anoth .
therefor , we should not take the matter quit a serious .
( da ) mr presid , we all use cosmet product .
this ha been a tough fight .
there is , of cours , no point in scare consum .
minimum standard should ensur consum safeti .

this is an opportun to democratis access to cultur .
art educ develop sensit and open up creativ potenti .
mr presid , i have alway consid all good sport to be art .
this all-ireland team won the six nation - the grand slam .
sport is art , art is sport .
we must recognis this wonder achiev .
this is whi we vote against this report .
that is it failur .
we need activ dialogu between european nation and citizen .
we need understand on both side .
we should be prepar to listen to differ point of view .
that is what we realli need .
may i ask whi that happen ?
i can give you the answer .
the peopl still look to their nation govern to save them .
the list of demand should be given serious consider .
we complet ignor the result of the vote !
that is not dialogu .
that is an abdic of democraci .
so i do reject the insult of this report .
it ha fail to activ engag and connect with the citizen .
mr presid , i vote for this report and i welcom it .
we do not just want to listen to one side of the argument .
they onli want to listen to those peopl who vote no ' .
mr presid , i fulli support recit 5 to this report .
that is democraci in action .
enlarg ha contribut to the linguist diver of the eu .
i am sorri , but this is mad .
it will lead to the opposit of adapt and assimil .
this is a veri serious risk that must be address .
we must not forget the right of local languag .
we heard mr lo curto speak a moment ago .
i do not attack ani of the right of minor languag speaker .
i therefor abstain for these two reason .
this is of paramount import to my countri , bulgaria .
we in this parliament must continu to insist that they do .
i would particular like to talk about the krehl report .
written explan of vote
on that basi i felt it appropri to abstain on this report .
i am happi to give my support to it .
i repeat that i am oppos to the report on those ground .
whi can we not just respect that ?
give child a chanc in life is an import mdg .
such decis should be taken by the member state themselv .

all child are born artist .
the problem is to remain an artist a we grow up . '
in write . - ( nl ) what is this parliament meddl in now ?
what nonsens , and what meddlesom !
we have therefor vote against the report a a whole .
that is manifest untru .
the rapporteur is clear , howev .
then we can talk about an activ dialogu with the citizen .
this report onc again advoc an antidemocrat posit .
you truli are incorrig .
i think it is quit the opposit .
we have therefor vote against this report .
the eu wa creat for econom reason and that remain obvious .
for this reason i have abstain from vote on this report .
it is therefor hard to speak of dialogu and compromis .
we need to talk !
in other word : yes ' to dialogu , and no ' to the report .
i can not therefor fulli endors the report .
nihil novi : noth new without the common consent .
what we need is to reach the poorer and le educ citizen .
this obvious vari from countri to countri .
it would be a great success if this figur reach 80 % .
unfortun , he is correct .
this ad valu must now be recognis and honour .
i am therefor against the tabl report .
let u be honest , what differ have they ever made ?
they look pretti nice inde .
too mani complex regul ;
inadequ decentralis administr capac ;
complex regul ;
lack of clariti in cofinanc rule ;
few opportun to exchang experi ; and
all these aspect are recognis in mr krehl 's report .
we still have no overal concept .
without this , individu measur are doom to failur .
this is whi i have vote against the roszkowski report .
therefor , i did not endors mr roth-behrendt 's report .
anoth object is to increas the safeti of cosmet product .
now the rule are be tighten up , and that is onli right .
there must therefor be proof of their efficaci .
the propos wa intend to simplifi exist legisl .
that is whi this propos for amend is appropri .
a littl coher , plea .
either it is health that take preced or it is the market .
for certain product , it can not be the market .

we must wholli condemn and punish these practic .
visit the doctor must be someth that is done voluntarili .
employ compuls in this situat is complet unaccept .
i therefor vote against the revis version .
this topic is undoubt import .
in some case the consequ are fatal .
i am sorri , but i have abstain from vote for this reason .
languag is in fact a fundament factor in social inclus .
this aspect is also mention in mr moura 's report .
that is not a matter for the eu .
we have therefor vote against this report .
i would like to congratul the rapporteur for this report .
we can discov in europ the valu which we have in common .
so the stake are high .
that make it respons in this all the greater .
this is not and must not be the natur of our debat .
they are also more creativ and have broader horizon .

howev , we have mani concern .
we also oppos the charg of an addit servic fee .
the regul on outsourc also caus me some concern .
unfortun , the council ha ignor these concern .
a further problem is the servic charg involv in outsourc .
i believ it is wrong to pas this charg on to the applic .
sinc 1997 , about 6 million migrant have enter the uk .
this is equival to a new citi the size of birmingham .

who are you aim to pillori for this ?
a brief remark on clone .
it is anim cruelti and we are oppos to it .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
a major consider is the strict regulatori system of label .
there is also a signific debat concern clone anim .
it would be more appropri to regul clone in a separ regul .
we need to make this absolut clear to consum .
after all , clone caus great distress to anim .
i also regard amend 60 a import .
whi do we distrust peer-review scienc to such an extent ?
the same question can be ask of nation parliament .
if not , our credibl a legisl is in question .
there were some critic comment too , of cours .

agenda for next sit : see minut
closur of the sit
( the sit wa close at 11 p.m . )
open of the sit
( the sit wa open at 9.10 a.m . )
( applaus )
the spring council provid proof of that .
there wa a relat strong turn-out .
i will quot one figur : eur 400 billion .
the current crisi , a we all know , is a crisi of confid .
it is not enough simpli to pour money into the system .
we tri that and the bank are still not lend .
the liquid that is avail to them ha not solv the problem .
confid can neither be decre nor purchas .
we have agre even on this .
we therefor need better regul .
the plan is alleg defici , slow and unambiti .
i would like to set the record straight .
the gas crisi ha not been resolv .
it is more than clear that we need this .
we are tri to find a joint posit at the european level .
the decis we took wa the right one .
the third area concern extern relat .
we are consid this .
this is not a technocrat agenda .
howev , the european council also look beyond the crisi .
this invest is critic in these difficult time .
it ha put the brake on invest in renew energi .
it ha also put research on clean technolog on hold .
therefor , we need to have a clear european respons .
i am veri happi with that result .
we also need to continu to deepen the work of coordin .
coordin is key - coordin and implement .
we have some instrument .
unemploy is rise and most like will go on rise .
worker all over europ must know that european leader care .
we have invit the social partner to come to the commiss .
you have a wealth of knowledg about action on the ground .
but it wa in no sen the end of a process .
we need to keep up the momentum of the process .
( applaus )
this is the mean of european integr .
climat chang will not wait for the end of the crisi .
it doe you honour in your difficult circumst .
( applaus )
so what about obstruct by your own peopl ?
that is what you said here a few moment ago .
that is the big mistak that you are make here .
( applaus )
the presid of the commiss said someth veri import today .
we have no time for that .
that is a fatal signal .
that is the wrong signal .
( applaus )
second , plea re-conven the social summit .
i person feel veri sorri for you .
we are here to help you .
( applaus )
( laughter )
all these are welcom .
this is a fals choic .
the long term and the short term : both must be address .
our leader must be clear about that at the g20 summit .
america will come to the g20 with her own agenda .
that moment ha pas for your govern .
for europ it is yet to come .
see to it that domest difficulti do not sap your stride .
( applaus )
howev , becaus we are among friend , we must speak sincer .
i will start with support for the eastern partnership .
it seem to me that absolut noth ha been decid .
i appeal to mr topolánek to put an end to this .
this morn i would like a wake-up call .
so , whi did roosevelt win ?
what are the four element of trust which roosevelt won ?
the first wa reregul .
this is exact what we have to do at the g20 in london .
second , strengthen the social fabric .
roosevelt 's fourth issu wa his econom invest .
we do not want to go to war .
therefor , there are two issu .
one is that we need green eurobond .
second , we have to bring the citi of europ into the game .
i would like to comment again on the eastern partnership .
the conclus of the summit in this regard are veri vagu .
it ha no desir to do so .
bingo , mr delor !
that is precis what they are .
that too is democraci .
that is point number one .
the system quit simpli work .
i think it is not necessari to respond to some attack .
that would not be a good thing .
the job summit .
it wa not our decis that this summit would be a troika .
the lisbon treati .
i will allow myself one joke today .
the commiss .
i have alreadi mention the stimulus packag .
there wa also discus about the role of the imf .
it mark a signific step toward stabilis the situat .
the eu must remain a sort of lighthous for these countri .
in conclus i would like to say someth about social impact .
workforc mobil .
this is the barrier to a solut .
the czech administr is manag the situat veri well so far .
- thank you mr president-in-offic of the european council .
i am sorri , but i have not seen ani concret measur .
yes , eur 5 billion , but what is that ?
that is 0.04 % of this union 's gross nation product .
i ask myself : how is that ?
well , the calcul is simpl .
plea , we can not do it in this way .
we are on your side and will support you in get that .
it will still be there .
if you can do that , we will be with you .
( applaus )
the european union must hold fast to it principl .
thank you for your attent .
mr brown ha not a shred of credibl now .
that surpris me .
this is where the correct should appli .
the european union must take a lead in that regard .
cut need to be made dure the crisi .
i do not understand that .
live on credit is the problem .
howev , i do not want to focus on czech domest polit .
ahead of u lie mani task .
a europe-us summit will be organis in pragu .
what must we do to avoid these problem ?
wait until the lisbon agreement is ratifi ?
peopl 's live do not wait , we have to take decis today .
how can this be achiev ?
my honour friend wa right ; we are live on credit .
we have endless squander resourc .
we are not manag the economi in a sustain manner .
- thank you , mr harm .
you are quit right .
we are all sinner - some more than other .
the haemorrhag of job must be stop .
that is the question .
the lisbon treati is old hat .
it is a charter for the polici of failur .
we need a new treati for a new time .
they resembl a victori statement of rout armi everywher .
that dogma is complet wrong .
my congratul on the result of the summit .
howev , we are not deal with ani of that today .
you have fail to integr your own govern .
the second serious omiss is the euro .
mr topolánek , the propos measur are excel .
at present they are onli propos .
a mr merkel ha said , what matter is implement .
you were talk about a crisi of confid .
that is what we have here .
it is increas unemploy and the wider gap that it entail .
they say that they have alreadi done what need to be done .
i would like to say someth briefli about automat stabilis .
thus , it is not quit so wonder ani more .
final , i would like to say a few word about mobil .
we could discus that for mani hour .
we have definit got thing the wrong way round there .
in that regard i am entir behind the commiss 's approach .
that is what the european union is for .
we , parliament , must set out our posit clear .
this sort of invest is furthermor especi suit to our time .
now we need real action .
unfortun , the summit wa unabl to convinc peopl of this .
this must not be allow to happen !
histori will punish those who fail in their respons .
the same must also appli to presid sarkozi .
polici must be appropri even in time of crisi .
whi not the czech republ ?
whi not ireland ?
let u have an employ summit for all member state on 7 may .
whi do i begin with these perhap unpleas remark ?
this global crisi is aggrav by a crisi of european integr .
the european union can not surviv with new demarc line .
i wish u all success in this matter .
- ( pt ) the summit 's respons wa not ambiti enough .
where is the decis to moralis the salari of bank execut ?
this is not the way to restor peopl 's trust .
that is an arrog statement .
will they never learn ?
implement procedur can be too clumsi and time-consum .
howev , econom depress is not a time for moral depress .
a usual a crisi provid opportun for reform .
and , most import , the crisi is no excus for protection .
eur 75 billion for the intern monetari fund .
eur 600 million for the eastern partnership .
is this a lot or too littl ?
is the glass half full or half empti ?
i see three main prioriti that we should focus on .
the first , of cours , is job .
is it enough ?
is it too littl ?
is the unit state do more than u ?
is it a match for what is at stake ?
determin to do what ?
that wa postpon until may .
( applaus )
precis the opposit is true .
that would trigger job and growth .
the decis we took there were fundament and import .
mani of you ask how we will tackl the problem of unemploy .
this mean there will be further talk .
it wa jiří paroubek , leader of the czech social democrat .
good luck for the continu of your work .

that is perhap a sign that he should reconsid his posit .
they are late come , but at least they are come .
this is by no mean the case .
peopl will start to talk soon .
the problem expo is one that , actual , we have creat .
there is now a new industri that ha been built in brussel .
it is an industri driven by lobbyist and especi ngo .
it is quit a sinist trade .
it is essenti self-perpetu .
so for those reason i vote against this report .
nevertheless , i did support this review .

an updat to reflect this wa therefor urgent need .
austrian aerodrom also come under this new rule .
all other object are of secondari import .
furthermor , novel food must not endang or mislead consum .
for these reason i vote in favour of the liotard report .
that is whi i am in favour .
in write . - ( it ) i am vote in favour .
besid , this had been common knowledg for mani year .
for this reason , i have vote against this agreement .
divid and rule .
the crucial object of develop the agreement ,
howev , the progress made in just a few week is consider .
i herebi acknowledg it .
so there will be no blank chequ ' : i abstain .
i vote in favour of the report .
this is not a satisfactori develop .
forecast for this year are not optimist either .
they point to a further fall in sale of new car .
this concern ha our support .
howev , there must be some safeguard .
this must be balanc with environment and social condit .
yet write a blank chequ is , of cours , no solut .
correct to vote and vote intent : see minut
approv of the minut of the previous sit : see minut
there are three fundament reason for this .
in fact i arriv onli this morn from washington .
i claim that this is not just histori .
when we agre , we can set the term of the global agenda .
this is becaus the choic of u presid matter to european .
high expect were creat on both side of the atlant .
the new administr ha made an energet start .
all these initi are what mani in europ have been call for .
the dialogu with the u ha been reinvigor .
your report is a valuabl contribut to that process .
first , energi secur and climat chang .
on climat , this year will be critic .
second , the econom and financi crisi .
there is much that we can do togeth here .
that is also whi i appreci this time debat .
we are look forward to a busi eu-us calendar .
we must seiz this opportun .
europ and the european union need to deliv .
your report veri right place a heavi emphasi on this issu .
we should concentr on get a deal at copenhagen in decemb .
presid obama ha alreadi right emphasis this point .
then we too shall have no problem .
the first aim is to recov from the crisi .
either we recov togeth , or we will not recov .
either we do this togeth , or we will not be abl to do it .
the european union need a strong american union .
in this light , we support the recommend of the report .
this would obvious strengthen that court .
i am not onli talk about iran , iraq or afghanistan .
mr millán mon 's report bring up all these import issu .
the same appli to issu such a tortur and rendit .
what exact doe that act state ?
in other word , it make it imposs to prosecut them .
the posit taken in the report is unaccount circumspect .
he is right to refer to truli share polit and social valu .
let u just do a quick comparison with europ .
let u take that point on board .
we still do not know that .
china should anyway receiv more attent .
china 's gdp is catch up with that of the u .
the eu should adapt it behaviour accord .
we need to remind ourselv of what we want to achiev .
one is the trade disput agenda .
i would urg you to find a solut .
we have ask for this mani time .
i am think about a chang in our attitud toward the usa .
all of this is import .
that is certain true .
we ought to take advantag of that fact .
europ ha no altern to transatlant relat .
europ 's ambit is to be a signific intern actor .
all european citizen must be treat equal .
the negoti with iran must be transpar in all aspect .
- ( sl ) the new transatlant agenda wa new in 1995 .
we are not deal with a financi or econom crisi alon .
we are also deal with a global leadership crisi .
we need to advanc on a number of front simultan .
yes , we can ' .
this is someth that we must discus veri specif .
what do we have to offer ?
now the question is how to implement it without lose time .
europ is extend an open hand to the unit state .
we can not fail .
i would like to make a few observ .
first of all , cooper in the area of secur must continu .
- ( e ) mr presid , we ought to shout out good news !
good news ! ' .
then came the eight black year of mr bush 's presid .
in conclus , i would like to add the follow reflect .
they are now respond .
we will , therefor , continu to rais this issu .
this will be veri advis and benefici for both side .
the report must be readabl .
- the debat is close .
the vote will take place tomorrow .
written statement ( rule 142 )
europ , on it turn , ha no better partner than america .
- the next item is the joint debat on :
the strateg context ha chang .
we look at central asia differ than we did a few year ago .
i will continu to have my doubt .
we would probabl then move for a postpon of the vote .
individu freedom are veri restrict .
these report have all prove to be fals .
so what is the main problem ?
turkmenistan is in mani way grow in import .
for a long time it ha been a veri inward-look countri .
the govern is increas open to cooper .
it grow economi provid opportun for eu compani .
all this is evid that turkmenistan is move ahead .
inde , the new leader are demonstr a more open attitud .
speak in your mother tongu , if this is possibl .
avoid chang languag when you speak .
clear give refer to document .
articul clear ani figur that is mention .
explain abbrevi that you use in what you say .
i welcom this report and congratul mr caspari on it .
turkmenistan 's energi and foreign polici are close link .
we would like to see a revis claus .
by the way , i think you have done great work .
sever speech realli seem like exercis in self-persuas .
so , between these two extrem , what should we do ?
my group 's propos is both ambiti and realist .
it can be reduc to a simpl formula .
we can not sabotag our own polici by renounc our valu .
so , how should we do this ?
well , we should take two pencil , one in each hand .
thank you , a alway , for your understand .
that is uncontest .
that is the point .
i hope that we shall togeth unanim document this tomorrow .
third we have ask for the releas of all polit prison .
we said there had to be extern travel freedom a well .
that ha not been deliv .
is this realli a countri that we can do busi with ?
it is to do with self-interest at european union level .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
what ha been given a justif for this ?
journalist and defend of human right there have been gag .
woman and child continu to be rape and traffick .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
so let u avoid be hypocrit , let u make it plain ...
( the presid cut off the speaker )
- thank you , mr beazley .
now the final speaker , mr martin , ha the floor .
- mr presid , thank you for give me the floor .
how practic will a human right claus actual be ?
some of u also touch on cooper with the red cross .
the czech prime minist wa there just recent .
this also appli to turkmenistan .
so we have to help turkmenistan to help itself .
the commiss can make a propos to that effect .
let u not forget that either .
it ha taken u much further down the line .
it would not have been a good idea to postpon the vote .
the debat is close .
the vote will take place tomorrow .
bi-annu evalu of the eu-belarus dialogu ( debat )
se we can not deni that the pictur is mix .
this should be the way forward in our relat with belarus .
we hope that the dialogu will continu over the come month .
we are convinc that we need to be construct with minsk .
we remain realist and do not expect ani dramat chang .
belarus is one of the six eastern partnership countri .
there are a coupl more point i would like to add .
my final comment is on a somewhat more person note .
it turn out , howev , that this ha not happen .
we must also be veri care .
i am convinc that the peopl of belarus increas want this .
- next is the catch-the-ey ' period .
i will give the floor to just three member .
that is not in accord with our rule of procedur .
mr beazley , the point of order ha been clarifi .

other thing have chang , not the regim .
dialogu must strengthen the democrat forc .
onli then doe it make sen .
it should not stab the democrat forc in the back .
i too believ that a partnership is prematur .
that notwithstand , visa cost should be reduc .
this ha noth to do with what wa said earlier .

in fact it wa our propos .
this is a guarante which we all share .
it is someth to be valu and never taken light .
third , we owe it for the sake of our child .
there are lesson to be learnt from our totalitarian past .
human right and freedom can not be taught in a vacuum .
that is the hallmark of democraci .
it is someth we should valu .
it is about valu more import than parti differ .
the studi will be complet by the end of this year .
i am look forward to the debat .

i should like to add one further comment .
both inhuman dictatorship deserv equal condemn .
so be it !
the radic right need it also becaus of the forthcom elect .
it ha noth to do with object , genuin independ ass .
it is not a matter for academ studi .
we have enough testimoni of mass crime .

( the member then spoke in russian )
they are terribl word .
for that poem osip mandelstam wa sent into exil .
he die near vladivostok , on the way to his destin .
in decemb 1938 his bodi wa place in a common grave .
we want to face up to this problem serious .

europ should therefor not remain inact .
you deceiv yourselv .
communist have no intent of bow their head .

we are not afraid of you .
china is therefor the first countri of which i think .

- madam presid , there is a further dimens to this debat .
that is a symptom of have been sent to siberia .
those who surviv know what that suffer wa like .
the greatest crime wa ignor becaus of due process .
even at that time , the west capitul moral to the soviet .
i think there are three issu .
that is the aim of the platform of memori and conscienc .
it is import a an instrument against forget .
hitler and stalin are two of a kind .
second we must retain histor awar a part of european educ .
the presid is short , last just six month .
there are mani differ kind of fanatic .
this debat is just one step but other matter will follow .

there is a clear link with the question tabl by mr batz .

i have no problem with this .
are we look at a wider rang of sport ?
member of the commiss . - mr presid , that is true .

they do not want to get into formal disput .
i think that is veri benefici .

my opinion onli reflect the commiss 's opinion .
especi in this area mani issu are interlink .

that is also of decis import .
what did they say ?
so , plea - a european system a soon a possibl .
among other thing , it requir effect antitrust legisl .
we should not creat regul base on wish think .
this is also wish think .
the principl is quit simpli not taken serious .
paragraph 7 and 11 togeth instil a sen of misgiv .
chang in this regard will promot cross-bord trade .
europ must have a european system , not an american one .
if we do noth the situat will onli get wors .

oral explan of vote
i believ that mr tannock wish to speak .
this had the make of a great report .
i drew up the opinion in the committe on foreign affair .
therefor , we had to vote against it , i am afraid to say .
we have just adopt the lehtinen report .
practic which distort competit must be stop .
these are not the aim of a social and free europ .
for these reason i vote against this report .
i am concern that the cost of input have risen .
the price for fertilis and feed have gone up .
healthi food is what must be made the heart of the matter .
enough is enough .
that is the real signal that must be sent out .
it is a corrupt scandal .
we serv nobodi by fail to recognis that essenti point .
the spanish govern need to act .
inde , he will think :
round and round it goe ,
and oh do n't you know ,
this is the game that we came here for .

the irish voter should be respect .
i consid this total unaccept .

i therefor endors this report with great convict .
that is one of our fundament right and freedom .
written explan of vote
this is the respons of the member state .
forg an econom allianc is therefor vital to both .
i therefor welcom the conclus of this agreement .
indic of origin must also be clear .
howev , some of the word in the report are too far-reach .
mani point are word in a long-wind way or duplic .
this may sound like a nice idea , but is impractic .
in agricultur , we consid this an import point .
what is the motiv behind this ?
an attempt to encourag protection ?
we have vote against this report on food price in europ .
this is whi i vote for it adopt .
the rise in food price in europ is clear for all to see .
the ukip will not contribut to this impostur .
i vote in favour .
the transatlant link remain essenti .
on account of this bias , i vote against this report .
transatlant cooper must not ignor the role of nato .
for these reason i abstain on the report .

it should also contain clear disput resolut procedur .
energi secur is also cover by the report .
such arrang could lead to mutual benefici interdepend .
in general we share mani of your concern a well a object .
conflict prevent is also an import object .
but of cours the devil is in the detail .
this is right at the top of our list of prioriti .
tradit , europ ha been unit with russia .
we should be clear about this .
this report should have serv that purpos , but it doe not .
the socialist group firm condemn violat of human right .
this report doe not serv that purpos .
it is not didactic that is need , but justifi critic .
elect , a we know , are no except .
( applaus )
none of these argument hold water .
this approach is prove remark success .
the eu 's leader were conspicu by their absenc .
and what do we , the eu , bring to the negoti tabl ?
that is not , a you will sure admit , a proper game .
so let u not expect ani miracul result .
anoth exampl is last week 's renew imbroglio in ukrain .
they are not about dictatori demand and harsh condemn .
we have discus the mani problem involv russia .
the unit state ha a differ strategi at present .
that is not a sensibl cours of action .
i wish her everi success in this .
yet the report take the wrong tone .
i am in favour of a pragmat approach base on interdepend .
they need u and we need them .
not everyth is hunky-dori in eu-russia relat , of cours .
the report right discus this .
we are concern about authoritarian tendenc in russia .
unfortun , he ha yet to fulfil this promis .
russia is a veri import partner for the european union .
thank you .
we must now tri to regain that trust .
this is one of our weak and one of our problem .
we have to see both side .
my third point relat to human right .
we will never remain silent when human right are be abus .
we can not agre to such an approach .
that is true , but there is no need to repeat it .
which one will have more impact on russia 's behaviour ?
russia ha no compunct in exploit such situat .
there can be no question of condon violat of human right .
madam presid , my congratul to the rapporteur .
i think this is an extrem import report .
so the real key is how russia see power .
this is veri danger for state that russia see a weak .
they automat becom target for the expans of russian power .
and let there be no illus about this .
for my part , i think it is a terribl document .
can we do otherwis ?
we can not .
second , the manner and tone .
it is a question of realism , first and foremost .
i hope that the commiss will not accept these recommend .
in my opinion the report lack balanc and is russophob .
the report is demand but fair .
i can support much of what ha been said here .
we can not afford anoth disrupt of the energi suppli .
the new agreement is one way to do this .
the other is through a better dialogu .
on the other hand , gas .
this is , a i said befor , a relationship of interdepend .
on human right we do not alway see eye to eye .
both are there , and this is the content of our mandat .
ani such refer would inde have been inappropri .
that is quit a differ type of issu .
that is one point i wish to make .
( pl ) the posit is therefor quit clear .
the debat is close .
the vote will take place tomorrow , thursday 2 april 2009 .
written statement ( rule 142 )
i welcom janusz onyszkiewicz 's report on eu-russia relat .
we have a respons to avoid trigger a new gas crisi .
russia is an import partner for the european union .
russia may opt for the west 's valu and standard .
russia ha to choos for itself .
act to the detriment of this world would amount to suicid .
russia play a lead role on the intern stage .
this is now chang .
this last point wa cover in last octob 's resolut .
this is one of the key element in the communic .
now , whi is this so import ?
that is a clear warn sign we would be foolish to ignor .
therefor , now is the time to act .
this mean either extend exist legisl or adopt new legisl .
russia took the initi in 2001 , henc the current unrest .
we should build on the work of the arctic council .
mr presid , yes , the commission is right .
second , the arctic environ is except fragil .
third , territori disput hang over the arctic .
the arctic is not uninhabit .
it is not an unregul landmass like the antarct .
there is scarc ani need for more govern .
it is good that the eu is focus on the arctic region .
first , it is quit unrealist .
russia and the u will not accept it under ani circumst .
we must rememb that .
this seem much more feasibl .
the debat is close .
the vote will take place tomorrow , thursday 2 april 2009 .
i have look forward to today with eager anticip .
there is a great deal at stake in tomorrow 's vote .
the protect should be equal .
mani of her suggest have been incorpor into the text .
in my opinion , we have succeed in do this .
not all distinct are regard a discrimin , howev .
you do not want to see equal treatment legisl full stop .
we have wait mani year for this .
let u just hope that we get that larg major .
i am delight that ha happen .
we now need that larg major .
everyon should be treat equal across the eu .
plea vote for it .
first , the inclus of gender .
we agre with the compromis achiev .
this direct doe not close or complet a cycl .
is that a serious question that we are allow to ask ?
the list goe on .
after all , europ is there for everyon .
the propos is reason and realist .
that includ your voter , mr weber .
let u take this step .
this is the cornerston of democraci .
this is unaccept .
this is the basi for the today 's debat .
this attitud can not be toler .
this matter wa particular safe in her hand .
this propos doe not compli with the principl of subsidiar .
this doe not chang anyth in substanc , howev .
one exampl is amend 54 .
leav to member state what is their , for heaven 's sake .
on top of that , there is the vagu of mani of the term .
we need this legisl .
the commiss omit to includ this in it propos .
you have state fantasi , you have not state reason .
( applaus )
no one , therefor , can remain indiffer .
what concept do you have of human ?
of that i am certain .
if ever there wa a subsidiar issu , this should be it .
paradox , the left intend to discrimin in this way .
noth in this report undermin subsidiar or proport .
the answer ha to be no ' .
at this point in the debat mr špidla will have to speak .
i am give him the floor immedi .
the basic question is what doe this direct defend ?
this direct defend human digniti .
i think that this can be reject for one simpl reason .
i just want to mention two issu .
one concern protect from harass .
i will probabl vote against both .
i believ that this document should be reconsid .
commission špidla ha comment on this .
it wa no easi task .
that is what this report doe .
let u support it .
it is practic and it is right .
the import thing is that we manag to come to a decis .
religi freedom ? of cours , 100 % .
freedom for religi educ institut ? of cours , 100 % .
that is not the way forward .
let u not add further except to those that alreadi exist .
these are exclus compet of the member state .
we have includ import propos .
let me give you two exampl of this .
we can not allow this to happen .
this is now come , final , to fruition .
this help can come from u in differ shape and form .
this is a complex subject .
that is pure and simpli what we are do here .
thank you for your cooper .
frank , this promis ha taken too long to be realis .
i would ask our german friend not to block it , plea .
let u actual rais our vision and get this agre .
i hope veri much you will be abl to do that .
is that not true ?
is that what you told me ?
you did not do so .
what you realli want is the reject of the entir propos .
mr pirker spoke about the labour market .
this is not about the employ of teacher .
let u plea stick to the fact .
nor are we talk about crimin law here .
we have done our best .
we have accommod you throughout .
the debat is close .
the vote will take place on thursday 2 april 2009 .
written statement ( rule 142 )
this augur well .
in write . - ( ga )
inde , there can be no hierarchi among discrimin .
everybodi is differ , everybodi is equal .
discrimin is a serious problem in europ and beyond .
i firm insist that we must combat everi form of discrimin .
it will creat uncertainti and facilit abus .
we therefor vote against this report .
non-discrimin is the hallmark of a civilis societi .
the next item is the joint debat on :
simplif of the elig of expenditur ;
what ha chang ?
cohes polici is a power lever for stimul the real economi .
these chang will simplifi the expenditur justif procedur .
commiss statement

howev , we especi love it when these text are appli .
i would like to make that quit clear .
we have heard refer to quota today .
we need it to be !
they caus a strain on econom , social and territori cohes .
therefor , we must take action now .
this is half-heart and inconsist .
whi is there no commiss action plan on region polici ?
on behalf of the gue/ngl group . - ( ga )
we are struggl with an econom emerg .
forgiv me for have my doubt about this .
in this way we are work togeth with our citizen a partner .

thank you .
( hu ) i think we should actual be celebr today .
it will elimin the delay in implement the fund 's aim .
where are the european polici ?
this is just one of the mani improv propos .
i think this support should be veri warm welcom .
this may entail reprioritis part of their oper programm .
we need to look at subsidi and various tax incent .
but we need simpl administr .
whi am i enumer this statist data ?
madam presid , i welcom these new propos .
we are now live through time of crisi .
we see huge job loss across the eu .
today the latest unemploy figur were announc in ireland .
these figur are shock and frighten .

it is a step in the right direct .
i am sorri that amend to these report were not approv .
i understand the urgenc .
madam presid , i would like to thank the rapporteur .

explan of vote
oral explan of vote
i welcom the report of mr takkula and i have support it .
this ha noth to do with the cultur of the european union .
( pl ) mr presid , i could not endors mr vălean 's report .
it creat legal chao .
in fact , european citizenship is high artifici in natur .
mr presid , citizenship defin who we are .
it is the bedrock of our ident .
citizenship lie in member state .
it should not be divert and it should not be share .
i reject that philosophi a i reject the lisbon treati .
i have learn a lot here today .
i did not realis our british colleagu were citizen .
i thought they were subject .
mr presid , may i concur with the last speaker .
these are differ dimens to our ident and our citizenship .
they are not contradictori but complementari .
chang , a much el , begin at home .
but sure the european parliament should be set an exampl .
i will give poland a an exampl .
we are oppos to that idea .
mr presid , i abstain on this matter for two reason .
first of all , we all accept some discrimin .
i support that .
i support faith school .
we are innoc until we are prove guilti .
of cours we are all against discrimin .
that is whi i abstain .
we are a world away from the real situat .
what this report doe is to correct an anomali .
it is right that we correct that anomali .
mr presid , this report rest on a conceptu misunderstand .
that is a critic point .
it is an oppos principl .
it is natur for distinct to be made on the basi of nation .
i , person - along with the major of my group - vote no ' .
whi wa that ?
i will mention two exampl .
i regard that a complet illegitim .
i vote for both part of recit 17 , amend 28 .
it is for that reason that i vote for the report .
i should nevertheless like to make a few comment .
it is unfortun that we have let both these opportun slip .
truth and memori have an import role in connect with this .
it is here , my friend , that you make your bloomer .
now of cours , one ha to be care make such parallel .
i realli wonder whether there is need for such a debat .
the clue is in the phrase , and the answer is social ' .
unfortun it also imprison histori and it document .
we would like our histori to be access .
europ must demand this , it must achiev it .
this is an import element in our histori .
mr presid ha this hous no sen of self-awar ?
my friend , cultur can not be creat by bureaucrat fiat .
pactio olisipiensi censenda est !
it is time for action .
it is kind of you to bring me on now .
that is someth we should make clear at all time .
educ is inde most often the foundat for achiev our object .
there are mani problem in this area .
what doe that mean to them ?
it mean the failur of their futur prospect in life .
europ is age .
this is a fundament issu .
i also have other object to the schmitt report , though .
i support the implement of the i2010 strategi .
final , it is vital that these are simplifi .
mr takkula 's report rais a signific social problem .
everi child ha a right to educ .
that is simpli contrari to the intern convent .
i think the answer lie in the paragraph quot abov .
i vote in favour of a slimmer but more focus eu .
for these reason , we vote against this report .
for these reason , we have abstain on this report .
romania is by no mean a uniqu case .
the greek communist parti vote against the report .
everi child ha a right to educ .
that is simpli contrari to the intern convent .
mother and father are the most import peopl for a child .
immigr famili have this right a well .
such issu are the individu respons of each member state .
i find this solut to be pointless and superfici .
we should strive to remov exist barrier a soon a possibl .
for exampl , the ep :
this is hypocrisi at it best ...
this is a serious attack on nation ident and cohes .
deep down , though , that may be just what you want .
this includ foodstuff import from third countri .
the key point address in the new text includ the follow :
i agre with the aim , but not with the method .
this is now common knowledg .
howev , there is no mention of this in the report .
that is regrett , but hard surpris .
it goe without say that we vote against the report .
it will creat uncertainti and facilit abus .
we therefor vote against this report .
that is whi we have decid to abstain on this report .
in write . - ( nl ) i emphat vote against this report .
i do not think so .
that is ridicul .
i wa plea to support it .
access to religi institut
matter of marit or famili status
the relationship between church and state
the secular natur of the state and it institut
the status of religi organis and
the wear of religi symbol at school .
equal you can not with impun shout fire ' in a cinema .
the pitfal in such a coerciv regul are legion .
howev , legisl in this area must be well thought-out .
to u , someon is innoc until proven guilti .
i vote against amend 81 to total reject this report .
the differ form of discrimin are a signific problem .
horizont legisl in this area is therefor to be welcom .
it is a bad signal .
howev , this resolut ha no impact on the legisl process .
it is up to the council to reach a unanim decis .
i am oppos to ani form of discrimin .
i have also alway been involv in protect these peopl .
the consequ may be dramat .
non-discrimin base on `` belief ” is also problemat .
insur premium will becom more expens .
would ani of the eu countri agre to such condit ?
they must not be held a hostag ' by the author .
i hope that belarus will take this opportun .
thank you .
i have one reserv , though .
i refus to creat a hierarchi of suffer .
this is whi i abstain in the case of amend 19 .
i vote in favour of the resolut on totalitarian regim .
we did vote in favour of the resolut a a whole , howev .
we therefor chose to abstain in the final vote .
we condemn the atroc of both nazism and stalin .
nobodi rememb their caus , but everyon rememb their mean .
that era must absolut remain in the past .
this is whi i can support this motion for a resolut .
this is an import element in our histori .
our group unreserv condemn all totalitarian .
it unreserv condemn stalin .
consequ , we vote against this report .
of cours , difficulti remain .
2 per cent of the popul is wait for cataract oper .
no updat ha taken place .
i vote against the own-in report by mr rie .
everyth that is exagger is insignific .
school is a fundament issu that we should today reaffirm .
that much i agre with .
i vote in favour of a slimmer but more focus eu .
it goe without say that we vote against the report .
in mani place it is right .
it is a solid foundat .
this leav doubt a to the direct of the chang .

thank you veri much for the work done .
we can be realli proud of it .
it is far from perfect but it is definit a step forward .
but there is a huge amount more to do .
what we have at the moment is the worst of both world .

staff number have increas just a dramat .
in 1995 , 38 peopl , on averag , work in each agenc .
today , that figur is 155 .
they have therefor been proper manag .
i believ this to be extrem import .
therefor we are not yet abl to grant it discharg .
this is whi we are postpon the grant of discharg .

it is , of cours , someth which we are come back to .
amongst them is the issu of manag of risk .
i will just finish on this one note .
i hope the commission will agre with me about that .
clear , global problem also requir global solut .
the situat in the eu financi sector is serious .
let me now turn to solvenc ii .
the current solvenc regim is over 30 year old .
i now turn to the weber report .
ten time , i repeat .
and we should not stop there .
the european invest bank could do much more .
this is not 1937 .
what we are miss is leadership .
that is one of the import insight .
four presid have been involv , includ the current one .
that is one insight .
whi wa that ?
the regul also ha a strong symbol valu , howev .
reach agreement wa no easi task .
i hope that my fear will prove to be unfound .
they are almost overkil .
there are no compar rule in ani other eu regul .
we shall have to endur mani year of veri littl competit .
should it be written off ?
we are not on schedul ; we are not up to speed .
it is root in the social and environment sphere .
this is what guid u in our choic of vote .
i believ that such a method will lead to further disast .
we believ this to be irrespons .
the commiss ha yet to even consid this solut .
person , i doubt it .
nobodi understand it - least of all the fsa .
there is no court of appeal .
there is no legal recours at all if they get it wrong .
there is no concept of caveat emptor .
china is not the onli state in this situat , howev .
we must be on the look-out for unintend consequ .
we need to make progress in this area .
this is an absolut huge challeng .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
that is ultim the way to make a statement .
that is all for now .
this is an estim that may rise .
let u acknowledg that and be radic and brave .
more regul and more supervis are the in ' thing .
allow me to summaris the caus in 50 second .
we have an ownerless capit .
they will be save by taxpay .
they therefor grow unreason larg .
are we discus solut to these problem ?
no , we are not !
the bank direct is due for adopt in may .
i call on you to do so .
all of these centr were suppos to have been proper regul .
let u therefor make a start with new financi moral .
what mr gauzè ha now negoti is use .
it is a sound propos .
yet it is not enough .
it is unaccept for there to be no regul in this field .
we can not wait for the unit state on all the issu .
a it happen , the rate agenc allow for this .
this is regrett , to my mind .
the same scenario unfold in the case of solvenc ii .
this ha allevi the difficult time .
we must also limit risk-tak and put a stop to excess .
the free market also need it boundari and rule .
a a liber , i can also agre with this , of cours .
let u not forget that the market economi creat prosper .
did they not have that trillion ?
from the sale of 400 tonn of gold ?
perhap the money wa borrow from a bank ?
we are in the process of simplifi administr procedur .
but i would like to point out two pitfal here .
parliament will monitor and promot it develop .
i believ that this , too , is import .
there are reason for this .
there wa opposit from the council .

the call for gender equal is not an attack against men .
energy-effici smartmet will also be introduc .

this is whi i vote in favour of this report .
take the label system for household product , for exampl .
we need tyre to be safer , more fuel effici and quieter .
we must monitor , though , how effect the label are .
the applic of the direct strengthen monopoli compani .
i therefor vote for this report .
the reason for my abstent is not complic .
i definit endors the report .

i therefor vote for this report .

2007 discharg : eu general budget - council ( debat )
whi have we done this ?
is it becaus we suspect some fraud or irregular ?
so whi , then , have we done it ?
natur , it could have done so by repli to our question .
what fund did they cover and what were they spent on ?
that would be absurd .
we on the committe on budgetari control are nice peopl .
where is javier solana ?
what is this off-budget account ?
the auditor say that this section should be elimin .
we would like to know what it ha been use for , and whi .
those are not audit .
they have refus to give u paper .
they have refus to give u document .
the second reason is interinstitut equilibrium .
so we are not say we want to do someth el .
we are say we want to do our duti .
our role a a parliament is account vis-à-vi the citizen .
it is also base on refer to document and the eu treati .
the most problemat issu is transpar .
we should not let them run ring around u .
this is beyond question now .
we can not grant discharg to the council .
this is not accept in a democraci . it ha to stop .
that is not all , howev .
the council must act .
allow me to give two exampl .
in 2006 , the council spent eur 12.6 million on travel .
this money wa intend to be use for interpret .
what do these eur 12 million repres ?
i would like to ask whi this ha not happen .
how mani such account are there alongsid the budget ?
what do these account contain ?
this we do becaus we repres the taxpay .
the council 's job is to answer our question .
we want answer to these question now !
what happen to these eur 12 million ?
what do the confidenti account contain ?
how mani confidenti account are there ?
we therefor have no transpar .
this is not democraci .
these peopl are simpli laze around .
everyth el wa discus in camera .
everyth el is le transpar than the mafia .
then there is the use of fund .
where do the mani million of euro go ?
whi is the council refus to cooper on this ?
where doe the money go ?
the problem lie in the capit citi , not brussel .
in my view , it behaviour is sometim rather too coward .
this will not work for long .
there is someon to take care of it .
after that , we shall take a look at the consequ .
we are not nowaday a fan club .
definit not .
we are a europ of citizen .
we have to be account to everyon .
the council must do the same .
it wa precis for this reason that we chose this time .
parliamentari scrutini is take place here .
dialogu and effect democrat control are a realiti here .
i wa mention by name ; i wa accus of make nonsens remark .
i firm reject this accus .
the data can all be document .
( the presid cut off the speaker and call him to order )
even then , it appli onli to the administr part .
much attent ha been paid ...
ah , the council ha arriv !
veri good .
( applaus )
perhap we can start the discus all over again !
so i will propos that to the presid .
( protest )
i am sure the minist will take that messag back to pragu .
the debat is close .
the vote will take place tomorrow .
the next item is the joint debat on
the commiss propos were along the same line .
more than half of parliament 's amend have been accept .
yet we did reach a compromis , and it wa a good one .
yet we should not wait two year befor appli this regul .
six month for cabotag and the 12-day rule should suffic .
i await fellow member ' comment with interest .
thank you .
the commiss welcom the introduct of a new 12-day rule .
this , too , help to ensur road safeti .
we are plea that this expir in six month ' time .
i have high hope for this .
of cours we do need a european approach .
i too could not agre more .
it is anyth but workabl , mr simpson .
it doe not work in this case .
thank you .
the thwart ha been fierc , which is veri bad news .
the content of this propos is both wrong and unenforc .
he will be support by the christian democrat in so do .
thus , i am grate to the two rapporteur .
that is mr ţicău 's report , then .
they are more expens than the french .
for there , too , driver are cheaper than in belgium .
english respect is destroy .
presid pöttere confirm the eu make 75 % of the law .
so , here we are , make legisl to correct legisl .
where will it all end ?
document are to be harmonis and check simplifi .
it is citizen-focus polit .
the increas in safeti and reliabl will be palpabl .
the first one is , inde , access to the profess .
cabotag is clear subject to some controversi .
it is a known qualiti .
they meet the criterion .
it is also a question of safeti .
you are veri often alon in the car in strang surround .
london taxi are also known for their qualiti .
we should share these best practic .
mr sterckx , do you wish to speak on a point of order ?
thank you , mr sterckx .
the other thing i want to say here concern cabotag itself .
then we shall be credibl .
i thank fellow member onc again for their cooper .
the joint debat is close .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
the next item is the joint debat on the follow report :
this ha therefor been dealt with in the text .
last , complaint manag must be better organis .
this is a text on passeng ' right ; it is not a text ...
( the presid ask the speaker to conclud )
there are huge differ even within these individu branch .
we therefor appreci your work on these issu .
it provid an excel start point .
i wa also plea to hear what mr svoboda had to say .
i think that a singl legisl instrument must be the answer .
in other word , we must take great care .
that is whi amend 81 is so import .
so i think it should be includ .
this is a good report .
a i keep have to say , the problem are far too great .
one group is particular depend on clear rule .
i myself have receiv some of their account .
it is a disast .
who ha deliv this ?
i hope that this also gain accept in one form or anoth .
now , unfortun , this effect is not be achiev .
there are mani task for the next commiss in this regard .
this is urgent need .
so first the servic and then compens for delay servic .
i am certain that europ is move toward a better futur .
that is the conclus .
europ is not the prefer destin amongst our own peopl .
they travel to the u .
for the rest , i believ that there is a consensus .
it wa evid from all of the debat .
that is what i wish to say .
the joint debat is close .
the vote will take place tomorrow .

that is expressli not what we are talk about now .
we are talk about a pragmat approach .
and if we do not do that , who will ?
patient are in such a weak posit .
that must not happen .
that is whi this is also a social direct .
that is what we are talk about here today , mr presid .
a compromis is therefor necessari .
final , mani thank inde to the rapporteur , mr bowi .
he ha done terrif work and i sincer hope he get well soon .
what , therefor , doe this direct need to improv ?
it ha to be plan .
we want specif legisl .
we , ourselv , go much further .
this mean that we are object , rather than subject .
i myself am a beneficiari of cross-bord health care .
i wa lucki enough to be abl to afford to pay .
i welcom this report and i hope it will get through today .
without a larg major ?
let u seiz this law and put the patient centr stage .
it is onli those who are desper who travel abroad .
this is truli an improv on the commiss 's propos .
thank you for endors it .
here is a case which is be hand to you on a plate .
let u not wast this opportun !
i am think here of refer network and inform point .
i would like to wish mr bowi a speedi return to health .
after all , they are at the merci of their care provid .
i wish mr bowi a speedi recoveri .
i also offer my congratul on this legisl .
i will name three of these .
the aim can not be to creat a market for healthcar servic .
on this point , the report is perfect in order .
this is handl veri well in the direct .
the right and safeti of patient must come first .
final , i would like to wish john bowi a speedi recoveri .
i would urg member to read what that regul now say .
this direct is about choic .
( sv ) mr presid , the whole basi of this report is wrong .
we must take care , howev , that this doe not go too far .
healthcar must be left up to the member state .
i find the legal basi a veri difficult point .
the committe on legal affair also gave that advic .
this issu is a prioriti for all member state .
it is a direct design for patient and about patient .
accord , we feel it is essenti to alter the legal basi .
commission , healthcar is not a good .
i will end by wish mr bowi a speedi recoveri .
the litmus test of this direct is it legal basi .
the right to health should form the legal basi .
the court declar that they were right .
these peopl now have a choic .
what manner of peopl are these ?
it would seem that new iron curtain are to be put up .
this propos regard patient mobil thus come none too soon .
we have all been wait a long time for it .
first , there should be no forc health tourism .
second , there must be some minimum qualiti guarante .
health is not a free market .
so whi not establish it direct in euro ?
this involv nation or intern hospit accredit .
hospit in the czech republ alreadi have to do this .
therefor the legal basi should be chang .
whi are you do this ?
so that you will be abl to say no ' , of cours !
the truth is that you oppos this propos from the outset .
you have tri to restrict , imped and ruin it .
you are now do the same thing again .
is there anyth more coward ?
you do not even know how you will vote today .
you do not even know what you will be vote for .
we all have a choic today .
i know which way i will be vote .
i will be vote for the focus to be on the patient .
we have not achiev a much a we would like .
this be so , the rapporteur ha done an excel job .
healthcar is not a commod , it is a social right .
health can not be a busi .
that is whi we intend to reject this commiss propos .
but let u now be total frank .
for me , that kind of guarante is absolut crucial .
( sv ) mr presid , commission , at last !
the commission and mr bowi have done an excel job .
the heat debat preced this direct is astonish .
but what happen ?
i am plea that we have got this far , commission .
you have taken up your respons .
may the council also take up it respons !
europ 's role is a coordin role .
inde , this is an import and most valid point .
this issu ha to be address .
howev , the two object are not incompat .
we have codifi this in articl 8 ( 3 ) .
this mean that it budgetari impact will also be limit .
this is simpli a question of patient safeti .
unfortun , this can not be accept .

the same appli to the develop of new drug .

for that reason we must reject this amend .
we must stand up resolut against genet discrimin .
amend 15 must therefor be reject in it entireti .
the matter at hand here , after all , is heal peopl .
who is to decid which life is worth live ?
do we believ that prevent mean prevent life ?

i do not agre with that .

oral explan of vote
howev , that doe not mean we must rest on our laurel .
i would call on the member state to reconsid that decis .
( et ) i truli have a lot of comment .
this step will help ensur clariti and reduc bureaucraci .
for these reason , i vote in favour of the report .
first , on the budget :
this land of such dear soul , this dear dear land [ ... ]
england , bound in with the triumphant sea ,
whose rocki shore beat back the wateri sieg
of envious neptun , is now bound in with shame ,
with inki blot and rotten parchment bond .
that england that wa wont to conquer other
hath made a shame conquest of itself . '
i wa unawar that you posse such a talent for rhapsodi .
you recit it veri well .
it is quit right for u to be talk about energi effici .
there is no clear impact on audio-visu artist .
european action in this area wa necessari .
that is the precis opposit of medicin - it is murder .
all this ha to be blame on the pre-access process .
written explan of vote
ani such plan should be avert .
that appli to their incom , pension and expens .
a a member i pay into a pension fund .
howev , i do not see this a a conflict of interest .
a an mep i uphold the citizen ' interest befor my own .
this will lead to more empti truck .
i support without hesit mr gauzè 's report .
he ha again shown his qualiti a a negoti .
the chosen solut , therefor , ha my full approv .
this clear doe not worri the eu .
this is onli one exampl of the fail of this report .
howev , this onli treat the symptom , not the caus .
in write . - ( it ) thank you , mr presid .
i vote in favour .
it is an import step toward equal right for all passeng .
otherwis we will fail both the passeng and the oper .
that is the philosophi contain in this report .
howev , there are mani reserv to be made .
some have been heard .
that is a shame .
talent musician are be short-chang by the current system .
these caus are general forgotten .
all our attent is focus on two other reason .
two area are stifl rail freight in europ .
howev , unfortun , the major did not agre with our posit .
we therefor vote against the report .
howev , the issu of pre-authoris is of concern to me .
prior authoris in this direct negat patient ' right .
in write . - the key amend on prior authoris fail .
for these reason i abstain in the final vote .
in write . - ( it ) i vote in favour .
i vote for the propos on patient safeti .
i fulli support these measur .
it is a direct way of provid benefit to you .
that is whi i vote against the report .
i did not support amend 15 .
so i could not support the overal report .

conclus of the g20 summit ( debat )
i will begin with a flashback to the year 1933 .
we must not give up these advantag at ani price .
this mark a strateg signific chang .
the commit speak of sdr 250 billion .
this issu is no simpler today than it wa then .
i firm believ that it ha a decent chanc .
we have an agenda full of import discus .
i believ this show disrespect for the mep .
you know our rule of procedur a well a i do , mr berè .
commission , i beg you .
trade protection is a potenti threat in ani global recess .
decis action wa also agre on non-coop offshor tax haven .
this recess demand a coordin respons at intern level .
that is the onli way that we can all come out of it .
we must howev be vigil and not be tempt by easi solut .
we absolut must lay the ghost of protection to rest .
that is what we should work on .
they want suppos to protect job by close off our economi .
it is a social market economi that we need .
final , we also have a respons toward the develop countri .
i have here the veri latest prognosi from the imf .
doe one need further argument to do more ?
let u be fair and let u creat the job .
we can do it togeth .
we have signific experi in manag such complic process .
they must be base on structur reform .
we have to provid space for new initi .
europ 's experi in this area is invalu .
thank you .
the worst is not behind u , it is in front of u .
now , the imf put the figur at usd 4 000 billion .
we are realli rais capit 's moral standard .
in truth , the g20 did noth to stop liber globalis .
it promot the imf without consid it transform .
europ , i think , must go far beyond the g20 .
the hous is on fire .
do you hear the cri of anger rise up from our societi ?
there are three immedi reason for this .
sever call are be made on the european union .
we are spokesman , through the commiss , for this contin .
this may be an opportun , but it may also be a weak .
that is whi coordin is especi import .
the summit mere point the way .
the result is yet to be achiev .
howev , it wa a start point , not an end point .
a yet we have no indic that this will happen .
look at the reaction to hedg fund , for exampl .
we should not have to wait ani longer .
the polit will to act should alreadi exist .
then we would have one summit le .
european have fail .
( de ) mr presid , i can follow on seamless here .
a thing stand , we can not .
they had to be confront with it slowli .
we should give them realist messag of hope .
that is not a recoveri plan .
clear , in this respect , the g20 wa incompet .
we still have everyth to do .
where doe this figur come from ?
how can it be justifi ?
we call on you , commission , to explain .
what we need to do now is make this a realiti .
we need to continu in this direct .
this is propos for countri which have currenc board .
a black , a grey and a white list were also drawn up .
that is what i want to say .
i would like to voic my disagr with mr luca .
the current economi is sick .
howev , i would again make a call for realism .
none of u exist in isol .
therefor we have to be veri alert and vigil .
a mr daul said , we need more , not le , trade .
the debat is close .
the vote will take place on friday , 24 april 2009 .
situat in the republ of moldova ( debat )
( applaus )
moldova must not diverg from the path of democraci .
journalist were arrest and persecut .
there is a further veri serious reason for concern .
three young protest die .
it is import that these oper are coordin .
it is essenti to find a polit solut to this crisi .
there is an urgent need for a function govern .
we continu to give this matter close attent .
today the situat in moldova is veri fragil .
the republ of moldova is our neighbour .
we are fulli awar of moldova 's european aspir .
in other word , we care for moldova and it citizen .
the head of state chang , but the citizen remain .
no topic will be taboo .
thus partner discus everyth .
let u therefor help moldova .
if so , what action will the commiss take ?
presid băsescu 's announc on passport also ad to tension .
presid voronin and his comrad must commit to that caus .
our union must demand it .
to begin with , chişinău .
promin person in moldovan societi are ask for an explan .
we must confront the moldovan author .
it is not a mere intern or a singl member state problem .
on the contrari , it contain a great deal of critic .
human right must be respect .
the medium must be given freedom .
maltreat of peac demonstr can never be accept .
i therefor urg you all to support this resolut .
the first type concern human right .
the next type concern press freedom .
the final type concern the method for conduct the elect .
you said benita is an instinct optimist .
this is not accept .
we are examin the legal of this move .
the debat is close .
written statement ( rule 142 )
it should be obvious whi this analog is not valid .
justic is the basi on which reconcili can be built .
this is not someth that can be achiev overnight .
they are lag far behind what is need .
the prioriti of the european partnership are also clear .
a much more matur approach is requir .
chang is essenti .
howev , initi at a polit level requir broader support .
the mission of the eu is clear .
croatia 's negoti are quit far advanc .
there have been call for consolid of the european union .
in this context , i veri much welcom mr ibrisag 's report .
intern develop is stagnat and european busi are stay away .
the commission met him back in octob .
the commission spoke of an engin of develop .
where are we today ?
the ethnic divis in bosnia and herzegovina ha deepen .
the lack of trust ha increas .
i would like to mention three import point .
the question of state ownership must be resolv .
the road map for visa liberalis must be complet .
frustrat is spread everywher .
third , what the minist said is also veri import .
the peopl in the countri need to do their own work .
our willing must be there .
kosovo is the symbol of this enterpris of polit break-up .
the report pas over all that in silenc .
it is , howev , histori that will judg all of that .
the balkan ' natur vocat is to join the european union .
the first is the disun of the european union .
until then , the stagnat will persist .
we must take that into account .
the balkan ha been and alway will be a european region .

we want bosnia and herzegovina to achiev progress .

the commission should know that .
this problem is get wors becaus of grow economi and popul .

a i said , a miss opportun .
other contin are often more innov than the european union .
our direct on ecodesign aim at innov .
this is good for the environ a well a for the economi .
resourc , in other word , are import .
hope , the evalu will provid an opportun for improv .
doe it realli bring about the innov we are seek ?
doe it save energi ?
doe it reduc wast and the use of natur resourc ?
i think that would be the wrong way to go .
the debat is close .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
written statement ( rule 142 )
i person will mention five of them .
i will now set out what we were tri to achiev .
that is direct oppos to the main goal of the propos .

mr presid , i will conclud .
import who commit fraud must be dealt with quick .
improv rule and greater transpar are crucial .
allow me , howev , some comment .

parliament need to be strict in this area .
let u go back to the root of the problem .
what are we find after sever year of oper ?
withhold tax , on the other hand , show mani virtu .
understand that one if you can !
otherwis , we risk impos a further harm burden on busi .
howev , that is not our main problem today .
focus on this is a way of escap our respons .
whi do we find ourselv in the situat we are in now ?
it is just a matter of increas the risk .
they get to buy chateau in franc or play golf in spain .
i think that that is not realli the point .
the eu first need to reach a unanim agreement intern .
i want to make this clarif .
the debat is close .
written statement ( rule 142 )
a zero toler polici must be appli to tax haven .
the current direct is hopeless out of date .
the reform is an attempt to address these problem .
it is far more difficult to includ other new product .
not all profil rais legal object .
howev , this angl ha to be proper ass .
it is subject to supervis by independ public author .
this kind of profil is a wast of resourc .
it doe not catch terrorist ; it doe not catch crimin .
i must begin by ask : what is a terrorist ?
what kind of feel do terrorist creat ?
they creat insecur .
we can see that it is neither effici nor legal .

it is time to call a halt .
israel 's behaviour is an affront to human , to civilis .
debat in poland is domin by squabbl between two parti .
i believ that we are make a fundament mistak .
compani which are grow and expand have a futur .
thank you veri much , mr pannella .
you return to work in parliament in rome .
their qualiti of life is also deterior .
the well-b of europ 's busi is down to employe .
and , a they say in star war , may the fourth be with you .
thank you veri much , mr pannella .
your word do not contradict what i said .
i urg you to write to the commission to take some action .
thank you , mr gill .
i have alway tri to allow a mani peopl to speak a possibl .
that conclud this item .
flu epidem ( debat )
howev , that benefit also bring a respons .
europ mean solidar in stand togeth to face this threat .
that is what europ bring to citizen .
subsequ , noth much wa decid .
what happen if there is a real crisi ?
the minist met to exchang inform , and plan were made .
is the commiss receiv all the necessari inform ?
i have my doubt .
the countri should have taken that decis togeth .
i am not blame the commiss , then .
commission , you and your offici act correct .
where wa the council , though ?
it is hard to do anyth with this council .
yet i agre with mr trakatelli and mr maaten .
we did hold an extens debat in this hous in june 2006 .
someth must be done about this .
we can not toler this ; the threat is realli too great .
it is time for solidar .
i believ a great deal more inform is need .
it is well known that virus do not like high temperatur .
those are all of the question that i am wonder about .
the concern is for next winter .
the same goe for the medic avail , of cours .
certain member have said that there is insuffici inform .
then we would be at the same stage a the commiss is now .
congratul !
that conclud the catch-the-ey ' period .
mani speaker mention antivir and the suffici of stock .
the debat is close .
the next item is the joint debat on :
this definit is clear ; it is precis .
whi tabl amend that are vagu and legal unsound ?
i call on the ald group to withdraw these amend .
i am work on this point at present .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
i thank everyon for their support and suggest .
we need to chang this situat .
the same appli to the issu of sanction .
therefor , the commiss can not accept amend 68 .
howev , this particular amend pose some specif problem .
that simpli can not be the case .
matern leav must not penalis woman .
i do not think that patern leav ha a place in this direct .
howev , the propos chang is still not suffici .
i would also like to draw attent to two problem .
we should aim to introduc remuner for care for child .
we are all obvious awar of the current demograph crisi .
( et ) mr presid , commission , ladi and gentleman .
howev , there is a lack of polit will .
delay and inadequ enforc are common in member state .
in the end , i can go along with 20 week .
my second point concern parent , patern and adopt leav .
i think that mr lull ha done an excel job on this .
this is what will strengthen the role of the famili .
europ ha laid down minimum standard for matern leav .
it is not enough to say that we defend these right .
the eu member state have differ social system .
i hope that these amend propos will be pas in the vote .
i think it is unnecessari to mention all of the propos .
the first wa the issu of patern leav .
so there are tool other than the direct , in my view .
this mean that a new oblig will now be introduc .
in my view , this is a typic exampl of upward harmonis .
but partner should be entitl to it at their request .
these are two veri differ concept .
we must think about child , commission .
i am veri surpris at this posit , commission .
this is precis whi abstent is so high .
we have to give our citizen reason to go out and vote .
the debat is close .
the vote will take place on wednesday , 6 may at 12 noon .
written statement ( rule 142 )
organis of work time ( debat )
not even a suggest of an end to the opt-out wa accept .
the council wa not prepar to accept this restrict .
what is the result of this ?
this must not be the case .
i respect that decis .
the realiti is that both parti are at fault .
this is a lost opportun .
the two side of industri should have been involv .
this is a veri regrett situat .
a i have said , it is not in the interest of the worker .
this is not true ; they are fool themselv .
the council did not want to put an end to the opt-out .
so plea stop say thing that are not true .
stop deceiv public opinion .
it wa an unrestrain attack on worker .
it is an honour to listen to citizen and worker .
( applaus )
inde , that is what the council also propos .
i wa plea that there wa movement from the council on that .
he ha stab the social democrat in the back .
member state have a heritag .
they do thing their own way , includ the way they work .
there is democraci for you !
doe that not tell you anyth ?
this wa even recognis by the presid dure the negoti .
it is regrett that agreement will not be reach .
i believ we could have reach agreement there .
the reason we did not reach agreement wa the opt-out .
the council wa not will to accept even this .
it then becam imposs .
this is unsatisfactori .
the worri thing is the subject of that extrem .
parliament ha done it duti .
they , howev , rememb what certain mep have forgotten .
that is the realiti of the use of the opt-out .
the council did not show ani flexibl .
this mean that in practic freedom of choic doe not exist .
in practic this is , therefor , steal the employe 's time .
i would like to respond briefli to some of the initi .
we are not live in the 20th centuri .
can you see this mobil phone , can you see these comput ?
the council agre to this but it wa still not pas .
a direct wa approv in 1993 which accept the except .
the rule ha it own logic and it is quit comprehens to me .
the reason for that is quit simpl .
the commiss , for it part , is readi and wait .
this wa not the posit of parliament .
i would like to explain one thing .
we were in agreement on everi singl case .
the debat is close .

larg number of peopl are injur or perman disabl .
all of this is simpli accept , a if it were an act of god .
the main caus are speed , overtired and alcohol .

trade in seal product ( debat )
but , of cours , there are except .
but what we have not done here is to regul hunt .
this file ha been , for me , a conundrum .
after our exchang of view , we were all in tear .
i hope the derog work .
the third element is the exempt for small-scal hunt .
that is what i rememb .
person , i think they are absolut right in this respect .
we are simpli reloc the problem .
you have solv noth .
i therefor feel that this compromis is poor .
i can see no self-satisfact in that .
i just want to pick up on some of the crucial issu .
first of all , this is a call for action .
the canadian govern ha to reflect on that a well .
we have a compromis on the tabl .
the usa ha had a ban for mani year .
mexico ha ban the trade .
ban are now in place in russia .
hong kong is plan a ban .
this is a polit issu that now ha it time .
it is much appreci . '
i know that this will be applaud by the citizen of europ .
there are foundat for our action .
onc again i would like to emphasis this veri clear .
the inuit explain this dure the consult .
we can not want to import this abomin into the eu .
no club or cudgel are use ; gun are use instead .
let u hope that i am wrong .
this is not onli gruesom but also total senseless .
i am delight with the result achiev , therefor .
furthermor this propos violat wto rule .
with this ban we are fail in both area .
it could be done .
this ha not been achiev in either norway or canada .
the rule are not compli with out on the ice .
neither can we find them altern employ .
the greenland shoot the seal .
who ha anyth against that ?
consequ , what is be done here is a disast for greenland .
treat poor peopl like this is beneath u .
a posit vote will be a vote for end cruelti .
howev , i need an assur from the commission .
the issu is whether they are kill human or not .

i believ that this is fundament import .
we also want to see anim test reduc .
reliabl european research and develop is essenti .
mani million of live have been save or improv a a result .
we have a good compromis in the agri committe .
a a result , there are differ level of protect in europ .
the propos is also base on a care substanti impact ass .
on the contrari , the two concept are interconnect .
these provis are the fundament object of the review .
we know that this is the case from the public reaction .
the commiss wa subject to great pressur .
i would like specif to thank commission dima .
this is an indefens situat for u in europ .
howev , it is a piti that articl 15 ha not got through .
this is not necessarili alway true .
we must provid a set of valu , becaus that is our job .
we must not lose sight of the object of the propos .
these procedur are uneth and barbar .
member state must take their own ethic decis on this .
the commiss 's ultim aim is to abolish anim test complet .
i would like to thank you all for this outcom .
allow me to formul some brief comment on certain amend .

i think that it is a veri , veri bad word compromis .
a parliament we should do better than this .
what we are see today is the growth of a new societi .
no , i think not .
we have seen this approach befor - in china .
inde , this text doe not promot creation .
this is absolut vital .
the final text is veri clear on this matter .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
we need judici control befor net access is block .
may i also thank the rapporteur .
what is our respons go to be ?
are we go to remain silent and not answer ?

i do not like it .
it smell a bit to me .
we have perfect good copyright law .
we have perfect good data protect law .
that should be enough .
i believ we have done someth good .
that is quit an import contribut .
here too we have had great success .
this is a great help for our citizen .
soon it should also be easier for peopl with disabl .
they must be ensur unimped access to mean of telecommun .
this is a realli import point .
these peopl often say that the internet is a lawless area .
some peopl believ that administr manag is the solut .
this is the voic of europ , the voic of the elector .
i support them .
i think that both goal have been success achiev .
of cours , there are also a few delic matter .
yet i fear that i still have difficulti with the packag .
nevertheless , i have a problem with this packag .
i have to say i find this extrem irrit .
this is an essenti condit for my support for this packag .

( de ) madam presid .
i have follow label legisl for the last 15 year .
what is in the label direct from the begin of the 1990s ?
it obstruct the updat at the end of the 1990s .

the european commiss 's text is a nonsens .
final , it is an econom and social nonsens .
the multin are demand more and more profit from research .
anim are often need for this research .
the scope of this direct must , moreov , be extend .
the develop of these altern method requir a budget .

further propos are expect in the come week .
the legaci of these last five year is veri import .
europ need it .
we have to succeed for the sake of europ .
we have shown that strong and credibl target are possibl .
there is no point in beat about the bush .
the current system of nation supervis ha fail .
the second volet , of cours , is employ .
we will discus the employ summit in more detail later .
the credibl of the european union is at stake .
for this i would like to offer you my sincer thank .
you said you would consult parliament .
we have no faith in mr mccreevi 's plan .
if you compar both paper , there is a huge differ .
mr nyrup rasmussen will express this clear and articul .
mass youth unemploy !
so we all have to do someth about this .
the time ha come to make clear how we will proceed .
my group follow that logic .
that is the kind of certainti citizen need .
he should sign it forthwith .
president-in-offic , your presid ha not been bad .
let him confirm his signatur of the lisbon treati .
these are the challeng of our time .
the unanim procedur is a mistak .
this is what the peopl of our countri expect from u .
it could almost have been done on purpos !
for this , you are right respect .
you may have resign , but you still have respons .
they believ trade union should prescrib your work condit .
in britain , 3 million peopl use the opt-out .
it busi , worker and public servic reli on that possibl .
it is strang .
we are in the worst crisi sinc 1929 .

what have the worker gain ?
what have the monopoli gain ?

you must be joke .
on the campaign trail , the voter ask u outright .
where is europ ?
what is europ do ?
this is not what we want .
you have miss the point mr barroso .
onli in this way can we achiev global environment improv .
we will miss him a great deal .
this includ my countri , poland .
i would ask that this also be taken into consider .
and the last matter , madam presid .
we do not want a return to nation .
i would like to appeal veri , veri strong for solidar .
i hope we do , and i will work veri hard to achiev that .
i will not stand for that .
our histori predispos u to be cautious .
i would urg him to revis his line .
we can not have a european union that ignor that .
we are now certain that it is not suffici .
the recoveri plan is insuffici and ha no focus .
the presid will meet with you here at the end of june .
some of the peopl may be differ but the work continu .
i think we did a good job .
i am leav but the presid continu .

that is a mistak .
that , in my opinion , is a huge challeng .
i am also against improp polit divid in partisan term .
the commiss will continu to oper in this way .
i myself am a parti man .
i wa elect to the portugues parliament at the age of 29 .
i have serv a opposit leader and prime minist .
henc , i am clear a parti man .
i think that is import for the futur .
there wa no divis on this matter .
howev , it is also thank to the czech presid .
this is whi there is a choic to make here .
the debat is close .
written statement ( rule 142 )
it is not easi to overcom the problem .
protection is for sure not the solut .
the next item is the joint debat on :
the mandat given to the presid wa clear .
in the short term , skill increas both product and mobil .
unemploy is the commiss 's main concern .
howev , we now urgent need to evalu it impact on employ .
the european dimens is absolut vital for two main reason .
we can design the tool at our dispos for maximum effici .
they need idea and project .
those who lose their job must be help to find anoth one .
final , upgrad skill and match labour market need .
i want this summit to yield concret , tangibl result .
i am hope that it will .
it deserv no le .
europ is not onli an econom and polit project .
howev , that would be the wrong conclus altogeth .
the egf is the babi here .
we have found a compromis .
i am veri happi about this .
there is still enough room for futur amend and improv .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
no we can not .
will we final approv a minimum wage tomorrow ?
i hope that this will help to mobilis everyon on 7 june .
adult educ play a role here in develop these skill .
there is also a need to promot university-busi cooper .
lifelong learn is also veri import .
it is import to encourag the member state on these point .
unfortun , in social polici we can not do everyth yet .
howev , the treati of lisbon is a great step forward .
we are also head for an employ crisi .
sever of the leader will not attend this meet .
i share the view of commission barroso .
the commiss want a summit .
is this an unavoid develop ?
no , it is not .
this will creat job and it will creat consumpt .
mobil is import , a state at the workshop in pragu .
i have just one question .
ha this regul been correct transpos into nation law ?
often legisl doe not allow the regul to be implement .
we are not see this at the moment .
it is time for consist action here !
worker then have no job at all .
how social is that ?
let individu work out their own salvat .
we need to achiev global intern competit .
all worker have the right to work .
our committe wa right , but we must go further .
what doe a redund worker want ?
he want to know what he will do with his life tomorrow .
she ha brought forward an excel report .
a you know , it is someth dear to my heart .
this would take away from their relianc on benefit .
final , a quick word on the european globalis adjust fund .
i am glad we have had a speedi conclus on this .
the crisi is produc a seri of group redund .
lack of work is the main caus of deep poverti .
econom independ guarante digniti .

social polici involv more !
buffer are no use : we need a radic chang in polici .

what level would the minimum wage be peg at ?
at the romanian level perhap ?
there it is around eur 72 a month .
i declar myself in favour of a social europ .
we need urgent action to retain viabl job wherev possibl .
this half-day troika is a pathet respons .
( laughter )
this decis ha to be left up to the worker .
the european globalis adjust fund is one such exampl .
( et ) i also support the reorganis of the globalis fund .
so let me thank you for all your contribut .
i think noth is go to be omit or forgotten .
it is be prepar in an except way .
i think that effect should alway be monitor .
anoth question which wa rais wa that of cofinanc .
in order to facilit this , we propos a level of 75 % .
mr lambert emphasis the import of social inclus .
the egf is also part of the european social model .
he wa right to say , 'a stitch in time save nine ' .
that is quit clear , and that is not it purpos .
member state still have some respons .
worker would then benefit even more .
we do not need to have a summit for the sake of it .
we need good and swift result !
at this stage of the debat , i want to make three comment .

commission , it is vital to prohibit blend befor 7 june .
madam presid , what are they tri to make u swallow ?
a mixtur of red and white wine in the gui of rosé ?
third countri are produc blend .
it is well-known that tradit rosé ha a short shelf life .
this can not be .
howev , i am from bordeaux .
let me amus myself by make a suggest .
here we have a rosé wine .
today , one-fifth of rosé product involv blend .
i believ that this is profound amor .
they all remain silent .
i complet agre with mr laperrouz .
we can see that again here today .
we believ that mix wine is not an oenolog procedur .
who is go to pay for all this ?
wine could even be made in thailand .
what is the definit of wine ?
this is my blood ; drink it in remembr of me ' .
if you blend blood , then you make contamin blood .
can you understand this disproportion reaction ?
have heard what you had to say , i am now angri .
i rememb that speech veri clear .
this is an insult to our wine grower .
that would be the last straw , in ani case .
blend wine is not rosé ; it is a mix white .
let u call a spade a spade .
watch out on 19 june .
rosé wine is an artifici product .
wine is a ferment product , not a mix product .
we cite a our ground age and the econom cost .
we also adopt the addit of sugar to wine .
nor shall we have the courag to do so now .
you talk about open up to the world market .
i sometim wonder , who is guid whom here ?
tradit our wine-mak ha evolv in europ .
would that be possibl in futur for these low-grad wine ?
therefor , we ask for your support .
on the contrari , suggest have been put to you .
you met our wine grower .

this is what we are ask you .
this is our suggest to you .
do not penalis real wine grower .
there is rosé wine , and there is someth el .
moreov , indic tradit rosé ' on the label is stupid .

there were sever area of controversi .
a conspicu exampl is the question of ritual slaughter .
this is contain in amend 28 .
may he also be present in the next parliamentari term .
this should therefor be extend to all eu slaughterhous .
transpar , which mean proper report , is therefor essenti .

it is not a referr back .
it wa endors by the confer of presid .

that will not be permit by parliament .
thank you .
abov all , there is not much left over for rural area .
in germani , this affect the milk fund .

there are mani factor .

this wa the pressur of obtain this hasti result .
five per cent is not signific .
moreov , we still have not decid who will pay .
will a special fund be set up at european level ?
will various countri contribut to a joint fund ?
the whole world , includ european countri , would suffer .
but this is onli a first step in a veri long process .

so much for democraci !
we are no better on the rule of law .
this is littl le than a bloodless coup d'état .
he is right .

britain will vote no ' .
let me give colleagu due notic .
let u not under-estim it signific .
not even in franc , for exampl , do we dare to go so far .

particular attent should therefor be paid to it .
( nl ) mr presid , mr dehaen 's report give me mix feel .
it remain their choic to do so or not .
there is a wider lesson to learn from this .
that is a veri high hurdl to reach .
that is the way it is .
they also quot referendum that have given a no ' result .
i have learnt a great deal !
this is describ well and clear in mr guy-quint 's report .
this would enabl u alway to help shape these framework .
that is not such a silli idea in essenc .
we urgent need to focus on what the treati is about .
this treati give u new object .
new legal base are also import , howev .
the czech republ is a parliamentari democraci .
it is becom an awkward process draft the budget .
we are now enter a veri decis phase .
mr presid , i welcom this debat .
it seem for a while that it might not happen .
it would be foolish of u not to do so .
this union of our is uniqu .
it is a uniqu democrat experi .
it is not without it fault .

we can not let the euroscept turn the clock back .
a ha been said , it is abov all a more democrat system .

we have le time ; there is onli a singl read .
it is not certain .
on this issu , too , we need to make an effort .

you have a choic .
they were hoodwink in the last debat .
perhap the step that are be taken are not big enough .
it is a respons to the chang need of the european union .
do you know what ?
in the end they did what he said .
with this approach , we will get result .
plea look around the chamber .
there is no such respons from the polit class .
( pl ) excus me !
i must protest !
mr presid , thank you veri much for give me this opportun .
it ha also been a discus about legitimaci .
i do not see that ani other posit would be possibl .

dialogu , even if a veri difficult dialogu .
well , sanction are one possibl measur be explor .
such is the case for the iranian peopl .
what took place in tehran is absolut horribl .
therefor , europ must rais it voic .
( applaus )
whi are we not prepar to put tougher sanction in place ?
it is the onli languag they understand .
my group reject such strategi .
the u presid also believ in diplomaci .
iran is a sovereign state .
mr presid , congratul on your elect .
let me share with you a coupl of fact .
( e ) mr presid , ladi and gentleman .
structur dialogu on human right ha been suspend sinc 2004 .
i call on the presid of the council to do this .
it is time for tangibl action .
this regim ha no place in the 21st centuri .
we must demonstr that we do not cooper with dictatorship .
this regim ha blood on it hand .
i sincer hope that mr rajavi is right .
what a differ !
it is to this that we owe loyalti .
mr presid , a crucial chang ha taken place in iran .
what doe this mean ?
we must not send out the wrong messag .
democraci can not be impos by such mean .
i ask myself who we are actual pay attent to here .
( applaus )
what is your posit on this ?
how is it current be dealt with ?
first of all , the iranian regim is unpredict .
i think we are unit in what we say and what we think .
i think we must then oper along two line .
the first one is fair obvious .
we must call for the releas of those detain .
other factor will come in to that particular equat .
they move back and forth .
we have the nuclear dossier that ha been allud to .
those are other issu that we need to engag on .
i am grate for this debat .
but do not think it is go to be easi .
( applaus )
the debat is close .
the debat is close .
china ( debat )
complex of cours bring opportun .
it also bring challeng of differ sort .
we pursu this through dialogu and through multilater .
i want to mention this first .
the uighur are a moder sunni minor .
they pose no direct terrorist threat .
i saw this when i visit urumqi four year ago .
here , mr bildt , is a role for the european union .
the uighur are a suppress peopl number onli nine million .
most of them are peac follow of islam .
the region is strateg but difficult to control .
of cours violenc by the uighur should be condemn too .
i do not think so .
the uighur are current be accus of separat .
is it separat if i am wrong imprison and i tri to escap ?
that is the onli way to prevent separat .
do we have to bow to a power simpli becaus it is larger ?
i do not think so .
we , a the european union , therefor have an import oblig .
we respect the chine system .
howev , that doe not mean ...
( interrupt by mr posselt )
we respect china 's unifi system .
that is what we social democrat are call for .
we want freedom of express to be respect .
it must be the other way round .
i wa therefor veri disappoint by what you said , mr bildt .
that is not the approach that we need .
this is deplor .
we must condemn it .
we live in a small world . we must live togeth .
the eu is a clear exampl of this .
that is the road to chao and conflict .
( hu ) the question is where do we stand on this issu ?
are we on the side of china or tiananmen squar ?
are we on the side of china or tibet ?
are we on the side of china or the uighur region ?
can a mother of 11 realli be a terrorist ?
where do we stand then ?
that is the question .
are we on the side of token autonomi or real autonomi ?
it is obvious to me whose side i am on .
i hope that it is clear to my fellow member too .
we still have a huge amount of work to do .
we are see all of these serious repress .
that dialogu is tremend import .
a harmoni societi ha been mention .
a partnership involv speak out clear .
i would like to say one last thing to mr posselt .
he spoke of separat .
so the vast major of those kill were han chine .
what el would anyon expect them to do ?
mani of the local han chine are also envious of them .
we should be care not to take a one-sid posit .
we ought to support the chine in solv their problem .
howev , it is also show the will to improv in mani area .
ethnic violenc is alway evil .
mr bütikof refer to the concept of a harmoni societi .
they are not there yet .

that wa my first point .
i think that would be a better approach to take .
we have begin , which is a veri good thing , i think .
in theori , that mean modern , future-readi car .
what about the public transport sector , though ?
brussel can not just criticis germani or other govern .
car product is among the area worst affect .
u car maker are a case in point .

( the presid cut off the speaker )

forest fire in the summer of 2009 ( debat )

it work well this summer .
i am delight that they have move this resolut .
let me move on to the commiss 's observ .

i believ that we must go further .
then you will see that this affect everyon .
even so , we still have fire .
there are sever document that point to solut .
what is the commiss go to do in this regard ?
we have tabl an amend along these line .
the sudden rainfal doe not explain this level of destruct .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
twenti live have been lost , all in my countri .
there should be no recur disast .
subsequ , we set up a fund .
two point must be develop .
first , respons .
and then , there is prevent .
we are told that it is the member state that must decid .
that is a crimin act .
let u take the first step befor the second .
we are gradual achiev this in road safeti .
they can find no direct link to climat chang a yet .
( applaus )
in this respect , we need to act and we need to act firm .
a the commission said , coordin is vital .
we have here a good resolut .

mobilis is therefor immedi .
this is logic , but need greater flexibl .

written statement ( rule 149 )
in the south of franc , 75 % of the forest is privat own .
in addit , there wa a special focus on rule .
we are awar of the sensit of the car sector .
on duti drawback , my final point , this is noth new .
such polici are legitim under the world trade organis .
there is one except , though , name vehicl construct .
i will cite just one exampl to illustr our fear .
switzerland , i believ , is a strong exampl .
there is cooper on airlin , asylum and judici matter .
so i conclud in ask , whi not britain ?
we , too , can have the kind of assur the swiss enjoy .
howev , a level play field will not be a disadvantag .
in the big pictur , we could be close to real balanc .
the commiss ha long owe this to the citizen of europ .
thank you for your answer .
i trust that common sen will prevail .
therefor , there are big winner in keep world trade move .
so i will tri and address the concern .
yes , i do .
korea is a serious market .
we are , in fact , an econom superpow .
the question is , is it the onli way of solv a problem ?
the debat is close .
written statement ( rule 149 )
that is not our job .
develop countri need u now more than ever .
public develop aid must be increas a a matter of urgenc .
this show just how much is at stake .
i hope i can count on your support throughout .
that doe not bother me , howev .
wors still , these resourc will not arriv quick enough .
noth justifi a reduct in public develop aid .
this attitud is clear total unaccept .
moreov , it is irrespons .
you also respond in favour of combat tax haven .
the issu of intern govern ha alreadi been discus .
to my mind , this is obvious import , a other have said .
that is also my request to you , commission .
i call on u all to act togeth !
the realiti is that imf assist ha so far been neglig .
there are various tool in place for this coordin of aid .
it is their respons .
i would even say , to the contrari .
this is a target that i can fulli subscrib to .

i do not grasp that .

all this growth is due to immigr and birth to immigr .
britain doe not need a common european immigr polici .
( nl ) mr presid , frontex is not work .
this is pointless .
it is money down the drain .
let there be an end to it then .

how will we restructur the commiss ?

that is your choic , not mine .
we need a strong europ , but there is a contradict there .
we are go to reduc your influenc .
we are go to weaken you in front of the member state ' .
there is a contradict there , so let u be honest about it .
europ can not work on fanatic , or on dogmat .
i thank the epp for the support it ha given me .
build this consensus in europ is critic import .
i am commit to that .
that is my question .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
it is a polit issu .
and yet that is , i believ , what need to be done today .
the situat is clear .
you were minist from 2002 to 2004 .
the next decad will decid where europ is go to be .
we grew up in peac .
we grew up in a welfar state .
we made debt and pas them on to our child .
but histori is knock on our door .
unfortun , europ doe not have a cultur of achiev .
i count on your leadership .
if you fail there , you will fail everywher .
i have never seen a demonstr in favour of a european tax .
when it come down to it , we all have veri littl influenc .
whi do you not use plain languag ?
this wa not the case 70 year ago when europ wa at war .
mr barroso , you have a special respons .
we need a leadership that listen .
you need to do more in this regard .
here are some guid principl for the continu of your work .
protection is an abomin - even for a former maoist .
human right appli to everyon , wherev they are .
you need to do more in this regard .
the eu doe not need more institut power struggl .
preserv u from that fate !
europ ha had enough of lame duck .
plea god .
are you that leader , mr barroso ?

will you meet the challeng ?

for this commit i thank you .
this is a strict democrat principl .
we need strong institut .
it is a tool box that will make the institut work .
our view remain strong negat .
it is obvious that we can not identifi with this major .
energi secur also depend on the eu 's neighbour .
you show contempt for the mep ' memori of event .
for this we need an industri polici to be adopt .
anoth matter concern europ 's citizen .
that is not enough .
you thrive when challeng .
what guarante can you give u that this will be the case ?
institut speak , we are on the way from nice to lisbon .
we must give josé manuel barroso our trust .
if you do not want mr barroso , who do you want ?
that is my hope .
you can count on the vote of the portugues socialist .
i wish you good luck and success in your work .
it is , in fact , about take respons for europ .
i would like to highlight one point .
in this area , we are face with sever new challeng .
when will the institut begin it work ?
can we expect concret and effect measur from the commiss ?
i believ that we must invest renew energi in this field .
the stockholm programm will open up new opportun .
are you satisfi with your achiev over the past five year ?
are we go to see more of the same , or someth new ?
is there anyth we ought to be look forward to ?

my question is : what about a financi transact tax ?
we have not seen his posit on modifi product .

i shall tri to respond quick to a larg number of question .
i person am veri commit to these issu .
this is a european creation ; it is a contribut .
the 21st centuri could well be europ 's centuri .
i believ that .
europ is the world 's biggest export power .
what are the chine do ?
what are the american and other major power do today ?
they are start to talk to u about combat climat chang .

someon spoke of guantánamo .
i myself do not need advic from anyon on this issu .
thank you , anyway .
that is obvious .
there wa job creation and growth in europ .
that is whi i have call for a new social ambit .
mr in 't veld told me that i had not convinc her .
you are veri difficult to convinc , mr in 't veld .
i believ that we need an industri base in europ .
i believ that we have the mean to achiev this .
that would caus divis .
we are world leader when it come to financi servic .
what is the point of hand over the leadership to dubai ?
i do not see what the point would be .
let u be clear on that .
some have said : whi should we elect you ?
you are the onli candid .
is that democrat ? '
i myself have veri often wonder whi i am the onli candid .
i lose to an ideal candid from each group .
yet europ is not built with ideal candid .
europ is an exercis in respons .
that is the reason .
europ is veri diver .
i can assur you of that .
some of them are still here .
i am grate to you .
your support is not a blank chequ .
i think high of parliament .
some say : you are too close to the govern ' .

g20 summit in pittsburgh ( 24-25 septemb ) ( debat )
the g20 process ha had the follow signific result :
we have onli just begun to reflect on these exit strategi .
employ is anoth major challeng .
this is a veri high prioriti for the swedish presid .
( applaus )
i will come back to this briefli at the end of my speech .
this ha involv intens regulatori work over the last year .
all that is alreadi in hand .
it is a summit where decis have to be taken .
you must therefor be bold .
now you need to start put it into practic .
that is the most import task that we must now set ourselv .
plea help u to take advantag of this experi .
for me , there are three essenti task .
we can not get out of this on our own .
europ must hammer home this messag tireless .
ultim , we want more european entiti .
i have sever concern .
the second question is about tax haven .
we know that this will not work .
a global financi system need transpar .
( de ) mr presid , we need democrat revolut .
it is good that there ha been progress here .
today we are talk about the g20 .
the de larosièr report is too littl .
the polit will must not fail u .
i have four observ on this matter .
veri well .
my second observ is that we must not fall for gimmick .
a great deal ha happen .
the citizen are unsettl .
i am expect specif - and fast - measur from the g20 .
i hope that the eu member state will all pull togeth .
they deserv to get the loan to which they are entitl .
howev , global econom recoveri is also on the agenda .
we must also take employ into consider .
these are the peopl 's real need .
( fr ) mr presid , commission , i welcom your determin .
guid principl must be affirm .
the crisi is not over .
the strengthen of supervis and regul is equal necessari .
plea make your voic heard abov those of the three tenor .
there is not one word on europ .
you must speak louder than them .
i agre that it is import to regul bonus and tax haven .
these are all necessari , but inadequ , measur .
it is more import to make an effort in term of supervis .
we also need to do someth about trade .
mr presid , i thank the commission .
the financi servic industri is on fire .
for this we need a consist approach .
first , we need more europ .
second , we need more state .
this , in my opinion , is an urgent issu for the futur .
final , we need a better market .
i believ this is essenti .
we can not be the onli virtuous one .
( fr ) mr presid , you spoke of the govern of the imf .
what is your posit on this ?
what is the council 's posit ?
what sum will you put on the tabl at the g20 next week ?
our economi are still veri fragil .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
i firm believ that we must take action against such trend .
a code of ethic ha been drawn up in hungari .
this is an extrem import task for europ .
do you not think we should tackl this issu ?
we need clear principl for bonus system .
we would also like to take up the matter of climat financ .
we also need global solut .
we also have to discus exit strategi .
it is hit the poorest in the world hard .
these are prioriti issu for the swedish presid .
thank you veri much for a high interest debat .
the debat is close .
the vote will take place dure the first octob part-sess .
written statement ( rule 149 )
allow me to express a few thought i have on this subject .
these undertak must be realist , fair and account .
a specif financi pledg is need to achiev this .
at present , four of them have alreadi achiev this .
recent , though , the role have becom rather confus .
there have alreadi been step taken in this direct .
the key phrase here is global approach ' .
swift ( debat )
the next item is the council statement on swift .
in order to do this , we need intern cooper .
that is in everyon 's interest .
this is inde what will happen .
i would like briefli to underlin some aspect .
that is what i believ in all honesti .
but there are some key question left open .
for me , that is a littl bit back-to-front .
just come out and say it !
final , let me deal with transpar .
that is real transpar .
we green will have noth to do with this .
an agreement ha been sign with the u govern .
an expert ha made an ass of this agreement .
which expert , though ?
we are therefor sceptic about the qualiti of his report .
we are count on the swedish presid .
we will continu monitor respect for human right .
mr presid , thank you for these import point of view .
obvious , it is crucial that the inform is reliabl .
natur , this restrict how the inform can be use .
in order for this to happen , we need an agreement .
that is what i have attempt to describ .
i am entir convinc that we will achiev this .
mr presid , i have a small point of order .
the debat is close .
( vote : 17 septemb 2009 )

i would like to make three point .
howev , some question do still aris .
you just said that there are no addit fund .
that would be veri import to u .
we now need a baltic sea action plan to end this .
i do not think so .
no , this is wrong .
sustain must therefor be includ right from the plan phase .
i would like to make four point , mr commission .
let u hope that this one work well .
the second problem is overfish .
research are entir unanim on this .
i can see save in link up local and region bodi .
our second prioriti is further infrastructur develop .
the first should alreadi be produc in 2010 .
unfortun , there are no social condit for such assist .
my second concern is about fundament right .
that is the least we must do .
that is whi invest in treatment plant need to be promot .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
one hundr million peopl live in this region .
it is clear that we face enorm challeng here .
there are also other partnership in the baltic region .
neither doe nord stream have anyth to do with this .
the baltic sea strategi is an intern eu strategi .
it will be what we make it .
i would like just to refer to three broad group of issu .
first , the shape .
second point : on manag and govern .
i think that we should not delud ourselv .

written explan of vote
the european commiss 's polici need to be reorient .
mr barroso is not the man for the job .

he must not be in ani way an advoc for nation interest .
i have come to this decis for four reason .
my support also come with some expect .
the failur of this strategi is clear .
the second will be one of ambit .
to wait for a phantom candid would be a mistak .

crisi in the dairi farm sector ( debat )
we are all commit to find solut .
you are , and so am i .
the top line is good news : price are improv .
you know the key element of what we have been do .
a i said , our current approach seem to be work .
they are not on the tabl .
i think it is time for further action .
thank you for be so patient .
the dairi sector is in troubl .
mani dairi farmer are see their veri exist under threat .
it would also make sen to introduc an earli retir regul .
an appropri regul would be need for this .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
we are all agre on that .
it remain for you , commission , to duli follow them up .
i look forward to your respons , commission .
ten of thousand of job have been destroy in rural area .
the european union had count on growth in world demand .
it expert got it veri wrong .
time have chang .
the milk price impos on produc do not cover product cost .
a laisser-fair polici is unaccept .
without the small farmer , there will be no europ .
those short-term measur requir immedi action .
they have to be control .
i consid it necessari .
and , also , plea tackl the marketplac : it is not work .
( fr ) madam presid , commission , i will be brief .
i think that there are two part to this debat .
in order to regul a market , we need public regul .
there is no other solut .
after this crisi , that is what the debat must be about .
the livelihood of dairi farmer are under serious threat .
financi assist is requir by dairi farmer immedi .
( e ) ¡bon dia !
the current situat is unsustain and requir a polit solut .
the margin that the farmer receiv is so unfair .
the consum will not have to pay ani more for their milk .
the supermarket need to reduc their profit margin .
i am concern by those comment .
i hope you learn the lesson for the futur .
quota have increas , while product ha fallen .
i can not see where the link is .
the market itself offer the explan for fall price .
what could european produc do ?
( the presid cut off the speaker )
i think this is the right decis to make .
there are , howev , two point that i want to make .
it is a short-term , knee-jerk reaction .
that is what i term a dysfunct price-chain mechan .
it is a shame that no one listen to u .
perhap you should do so now .
we must find common solut .
they receiv onli 19 cent per litr .
the market is not work .
there is over-product .
the crisi ha not ea .
we have to be care .
we are not the mouthpiec for the farmer ' interest .
those measur do exist , we will grant you that .
( e ) we can not allow the milk sector to collaps .
we must prevent these fall into a negat situat .
we need anti-cycl action and joint initi .
this must be correct .
that wa a veri poor and short-sight decis .
dairi produc do not need your compass , commission .
dairi produc need a genuin agricultur polici .
they need strict quota .
we are all deepli shaken by what ha happen .
this ha to chang .
in my view , this is an insult to our farmer .
this problem ha to be resolv .
this is now even put at risk the upkeep of rural area .
mr bové is quit right and mr fajmon profound ...
( the presid cut off the speaker )
my second question is the follow .
we are ask for specif advic or a propos on how ...
( the presid cut off the speaker )
( de ) mr presid , we save the bank , becaus we had to .
i belong to a generat which experienc food ration .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
i have actual listen veri care .
that must be veri clear .
so these structur chang are take place anyway .
that is i think the right polici .
we are not introduc a new super levi system .
just on some of the promot .
so i think there are lot of possibl .
germani ha a tradit or number of discount supermarket .
it ha been a veri interest discus here today .
the debat is close .
the vote will take place today at 12.00 .
written statement ( rule 149 )
they all agre .
cash flow in the sector is dri up .
without this , price will becom unpredict .
but quota alon will not save the dairi sector .
export refund
process aid
extend full-pric intervent
longer privat storag scheme for butter
care handl of stock
the surviv of milk produc is now serious under threat .
the commiss must stabilis the dairi market in europ quick .
thank you .
energi secur ( nabucco and desertec ) ( debat )
second , issu relat to sustain .
first of all , nabucco .
we made a major breakthrough this juli .
where are the difficulti ?
the philosophi are differ .
i believ that the transit issu is more or le solv .
we have launch a call for propos .
there are two type of interconnect that we need to separ .
one relat to the philosophi and market .
i believ that desertec will come step by step .
we have also provid for commerci incent .
this hous ha been a veri strong support of energi effici .
it realli is the biggest element .
cc is usual need for two reason .
so , diversif also cover suppli .
all other geopolit consider must be set asid .
a you quit right said , diversif is also necessari .
my third point concern the solidar that is need in the eu .
you also talk about desertec .
this ha to stop .
mr presid , there are two point that i want to make .
busi emphat doe have a role to play .
this also appli to europ in intern relat .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
what is desertec all about ?
it is much more like to be just a veri expens dessert .
desertec and nabucco are import instrument in this regard .
this is also an import task for u .
that is the crucial point that we need to get across here .
that should not be seen a a contradict .
i believ that we will then inde find an appropri solut .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
i will give you the exampl of my countri .
desertec and nabucco are central to meet these challeng .
well , it should be , and it must be .
the success of these plan depend sole on our polit will .
amend to the treati are a lesser issu .
azerbaijan promis everyon gas .
i am of cours talk about nuclear energi .
this situat must be turn on it head .
mr presid , we have three main concern with nabucco .
the commiss should be in favour of nabucco .
a similar situat also prevail in baumgarten , austria .
mr presid , europ 's futur depend on secur energi .
in relat to mani of these there is a connect develop issu .
this opportun must not be squander .
here , too , there is not just one answer .
compani must be encourag .
we owe this to our child and grandchild .
we just have to look at the map .
south stream definit mean increas depend on russian gas .
in the south , there is the south stream project .
here , too , the eu member state are keen to get involv .
mani of you have spoken about russia .
next , how can we guarante energi secur ?
mr piebalg , congratul on all that you are do .
a for gas , we are go to have a gas war .
we must therefor prepar to import gas .
this is an excel project for the euro-mediterranean area .
much depend on relat with turkey .
thank you for your attent .
the origin promis wa for some eur 30 million .
we need to realis that we have to go further .
commission , what about the come winter ?
i am talk about the arctic region .
it is not in europ 's interest .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
i have a question for the commiss .
is someth alreadi be consid in this regard ?
what can we expect from the next commiss in this area ?
in the uk we are keen on new nuclear power station a well .
but of cours there is no one answer to ensur our suppli .
all technolog must be consid .
energi effici must also be improv .
i would also like to make two further quick point .
it is not a quick fix .
i would like to say someth more about this .
this is good news .
howev , regul on transpar can be easili circumv .
mr presid , the open market is a joint european achiev .
let u not make ourselv vulner precis on this issu .
we need a secur and diversifi suppli .
we all agre on that .
even the current level of fund point to this fact .
this is our overarch goal .
there are no compromis either on enlarg or on human right .
so i believ that is the right support to give .
but i doubt that we could go further than that .
thank you veri much for this debat .
the debat is close .
the vote will take place today at 12.00 .
written statement ( rule 149 )
bulgaria ha also contribut in this respect .

you can count on the ppe to help work progress quick .
mr presid , we are discus the result of this referendum .
like the rest of u , mr barroso , you were veri plea .
it is not about institut game that are now to be play .
china ha 1.3 billion inhabit . india ha 1.1 billion .
these countri now sit round the tabl in the g20 talk .
there are two option open to u .
that is the explicit goal of the treati of lisbon .
we need to ask mr klaus a question .
that is the crucial question .
we have to thank brian cowen .
so i am happi .
now is the time to bring this process final to an end .
what do we do in the meantim ?
we need action and we need action urgent .
that wa your argument .
i say that is not a problem : prepar your global packag .
and we still do not have to wait for sever week and month .
in ani case , you have said that there is no time to wast .
put the commiss togeth now , a fast a possibl .
so you react depend on your mood .
i believ that the debat on europ need to continu .
then there wa a confront and the major won .
that is life ; that is how it is .
we are go to have a presid of the european council .
i do not want this to be a coup d'état .
that is not a public democrat debat .
we need to put everyth on the tabl and then you decid .
the same thing appli to the high repres .
put your propos on the tabl .
i have one thing to say to you .
it all depend on the czech .
howev , there is anoth consider .
everyth need to be put on the tabl .
the treati of lisbon is not the end of the stori .
the socialist and the liber reneg on their promis .
the lisbon treati ha therefor been a miss opportun .
i know the detail well , the good point a well a the bad .
the uk conserv have been consist .
we should all reflect on that .
now they have the result they want .
this is someth that we can not support .
we must combat wage dump .
that is polit absurd !
the whole thing wa a travesti !
oh , so you respect this vote , do you ?
you did not respect the last vote , did you ?
the whole thing wa an outrag .
that wa what it wa all about .
i suspect that it is all over .
( mix reaction )
... there is a real debat , there is a real debat here .
what is the point of ani of it ?
it would certain have result in a reject .
that is good .
that is also what i am tri to achiev here .
onc the 27th countri ha ratifi , we will move on .
ireland ha not ratifi .
it need parliamentari ratif befor the process is complet .
that wa a wise decis of the european parliament .
so the question is : how long doe it take ?
for that , i need the council to take some decis .
some of you said that there will be a presid of europ ' .
i am sorri : there will not be a presid of europ ' .
( applaus )
we have to respect the institut .
we can not assum that peopl will appreci it benefit .
there is inde uniti in diver .
that wa democraci in action at everi level .
let me now rais one issu which i feel need to be rais .
that is what the whole eu project is about .
i repeat : uniti in diver .
i am happi to say that i call it correct .
they want tangibl action , not rhetor .
and i mean all of them .
who will benefit from the lisbon treati ?
plea could you answer this ?
( ga ) mr presid , the peopl of ireland have spoken .
i accept that .
it wa not .
that is the realiti that we all have to base our posit on .
ireland is a democrat state .
it is an independ democrat state .
that is not democraci .
i expect the minor to accept the outcom .
we can see a democrat major and a block minor .
we have work to do now and we must not wast ani time .
he think it is we parliamentarian .
if not , we will not be taken serious .
our citizen want a clear and substant answer .
that is absolut clear .
that is my , and our , opinion .
you must be awar of that .
these are our rule , and we must keep to them veri strict .
we had posit referendum in luxembourg and in spain .
this one wa therefor by no mean the first .
it is alway amus to listen to mr farag .
today , howev , it wa not amus .
the euroscept are inde poor loser .
the shock of a two-third major realli cut to the quick .
today , for onc , it wa not entertain to listen to you .
i veri much hope that at some point , that will chang .
is there enough democraci in europ ?
is the democraci in europ perfect ?
by no mean , but it wa a good day for democraci in europ .
now some peopl are complain that ireland wa pressuris .
that simpli did not work .
we can not pressuris our member state .
they have the sovereign right to decid on these matter .
ireland experienc european solidar dure the crisi .
that is a posit thing !
european solidar is a good thing .
when this is the result , i think it is a veri good thing .
the treati open up new opportun .
we must speak with one voic .
that will be the litmus test - includ in the commiss hear .
i expect you to take this extrem serious .
onli then can we gain the support of the european elector .
all falsehood .
the eu commiss interven continu : interf in the process .
what is your answer to that ?
let u be clear .
mr toni blair is a war crimin .
under no circumst can he be -
i wa interrupt unnecessarili , mr presid .
i think you are in the chair , not the honour member here .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
i can see a blue card .
finland , a small countri , wa right there .
nevertheless , we cope ; we were independ .
if you win by foul mean , you have alreadi lost .
it wa won by foul mean , wa it not ?
look where maradona is now , he who won by foul mean .
in this case , howev , it wa just a year later .
the big countri will gain in strength .
i love ireland ; i have been there 20 time .
i becam a cathol in ireland .
it is not about that .
i am just sorri to see such a massiv landslid .
first there were 53 % against and 47 % in favour .
this time the result wa 67 % in favour and 33 % against .
what happen and whi ?
i maintain that it wa fear .
( liisa jaakonsaari comment without use the microphon )
thank you veri much .
the subject of a new basic treati wa first discus in 2002 .
poland announc that it is go to ratifi the treati immedi .
we have certain lost time .
we have lost year .
europ ha fallen behind in intern term .
we onli need to look at the g20 meet to see that .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
i hope it will continu to do so .
the conduct of gordon brown is particular reprehens .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
i believ that the peopl wish to see greater democraci ...
( the presid cut off the speaker )
i believ that it will result in a centralis superst .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
they can not get away from this fact .
the paper that i have so far ...
( the presid cut off the speaker )
the czech have also said yes ' to the lisbon treati .
the czech republ is a parliamentari democraci .
the author of it presid depend on the will of parliament .
it is now up to the rest of u .
i think we can all agre about that .
that is like say that elect can not be held more than onc .
this is whi we have democraci and whi we vote sever time .
poland should not be a problem .
he ha a good relationship with david cameron .
we need a strong ...
( the presid cut off the speaker )
can i assur them that he doe .
if it is the first case , then it is a 3-3 score draw .
hard a ring endors for the lisbon treati .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
now , in this chamber , we have befor u a great task .
we are go to be present big european project .
i hope that europ will no longer need to hold it breath .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
mr presid , the decis is made .
i wish to say no more about it .
therefor , mani voter stay at home .
eu democraci is a one-way street .
there wa no fair campaign .
the voter were intimid .
that is the most signific achiev of the treati of lisbon .
that is also someth that i would like to see .
that is not possibl .
i would like to say thank you to nigel farag .
the torus , on the other hand , are in total disarray .
david cameron 's posit on the lisbon treati is quit unten .
at best , he can be accus of dither .
they would like u spectat rather than influenc .
they pretend they have chang but they clear have not .
so come on , mr cameron , come clean and tell u the truth .
ireland should be thank for this .
we are therefor veri plea with the irish peopl 's decis .
what ha chang ?
the text ?
veri littl .
the context ?
that is what matter .
we can discus institut question here .
what the citizen are wait for are polit answer from europ .
there is not just one vote , there are two .
the no ' to start with and then the yes ' .
i shall repeat what numer member have said .
i think that we need to proceed quick now .
allow me to make an observ .
this includ area such a person data protect .
whi might this be ?
the czech case is a differ one .
we can not accept be prison of filibust .
parliament should be fulli involv in this process .
the treati of lisbon mark the begin of a new era .
mr presid , it ha been a long debat but not veri dramat .
i think we are all of u to blame for that .
it did not happen .
it will never happen .
it will also make linguist and cultur diver an eu norm .
thank you for your attent .
mr presid , i stand here today a a proud irish mep .

last weekend wa a triumph for communic .
you have often heard about communic deficit .
that would be total unaccept .
will europ be readi to do so ?
it is still hard to say .
the eu 's own secur and develop also depend on this .
we should prepar for the futur .
europ is our home .
this is certain true of the treati of lisbon .
this treati ha come a veri long way .
amongst them is a colleagu of mine , méndez de vigo .
a politician , we have to shoulder huge respons .
we can now look forward optimist to finalis ratif .
our journey thus far ha been long and arduous .
it ha to be use and it ha to be effect .
some peopl appear to be confus on this point .
what can this be attribut to ?
one reason is that the irish were given a guarante .
this is what would also be need to protect europ 's minor .
howev , there are at least two aspect that requir caution .
i onli wish that we were smarter than that .
but who in here realli care ?
well , i do .
this is not fair and is , in my view , moral wrong .
it is quit like to be toni blair .
the new presid of the eu will be the head of state .
god save our queen !
plea help save romania .
i am make an so appeal on behalf of the romanian peopl .
it is veri democrat .
you find out the reason .
with this clarif you have a new referendum .
i also sen a certain frustrat in here about the timet now .
the timet in pragu is still a littl bit unclear .
meanwhil , the presid is work , of cours .
there will be .
but all those name mention are name in the medium .
we need to do that .
thank you veri much for an interest debat , mr presid .
could i just start with some fact .
i think it is veri import to say this .
now ireland decid to carri out a second referendum .
and whi did they do that ?
and this is what wa done .
whi do we have to explain ?
so they look at the reason .
i wa there myself .
what kind of statement are these ?
should i believ in them ?
this is what happen .
of cours , we do not debat these thing in a polit vacuum .
you have to provid inform and a debat and a discus .
the downsid is that it also divid the popul .
the debat is close .
written statement ( rule 149 )
the irish vote is a definit vote in favour of europ .
howev , polit will is need to tackl these challeng .
mr presid , ladi and gentleman , who are we laugh at ?
the delay ha now last for over one and a half year .
this is unjustifi , reprehens , and even illeg .
in not fulfil this oblig , he is break the law .
if so , it is high time to initi the procedur for impeach .
we wait with hope for the final ratif of the treati .
the devil is in the detail .
situat in guinea ( debat )
the violenc in guinea receiv worldwid condemn .
we have not been alon .
our intern partner have act in line with u .
well , there are three main area of action .
we discus the effect of develop cooper fair often .
this is not true .
franc ha not humili african .
it is a paradox , but the situat is fair simpl .
we must demand a halt to the use of violenc .
let u hope that it will be effect .
it is time for this infern spiral to come to an end .
last , there is the question of justic .
the news reach u from guinea is alarm .
you have talk to u about target sanction , minist .
could you tell u more about this ?
howev , could you give u some more inform about this too ?
i will say it onc again : this is a matter of urgenc .
we have stuck to this all year .
it reflect the commiss 's evalu of the previous agreement .
they relat to the previous regim .
i believ that he must be support by our diplomat effort .
in fact , it vote by just one vote to do so .
that is the onli way we can realli exercis pressur .
we have the intern contact group .
the whole world communiti ha ask for that to happen .
it is the commiss which is respons for eu fisheri polici .
my thank to you and to the member for this debat .
thank you veri much , mr malmström .
the debat is close .
one-minut speech on matter of polit import
it may have been forese , but noth wa done to prevent it .
the situat in northern portug is an illustr of this .
mani other are at risk of close .
just take a look at what ha happen with the lisbon treati .
i would like your constitu to ask you to do that , too .
welcom to absurdistan !
in my opinion , this is a veri unfortun state of affair .
howev , you did not utilis this opportun .
they were hand down sentenc rang from 10 to 15 year .
this give a ratio of 300 to 1 .
this is extrem urgent .
mr ivanilova must be allow to return to lithuania .
he need immedi medic attent .
the european union 's common posit must not be wast .
none of this is true .
there is onli one explan : poland is a church state .
the european parliament should react to this .
this is no coincid .
it ha instil fear in peopl .
all too often , those word are unchalleng by journalist .
howev , hyperbol can turn to insan .
nevertheless , we should be compassion .
parliament ha a medic servic .
i would like to give you a posit exampl in this area .
i put forward certain concret measur , but noth wa done .
franc is take this action and we can see the result .
( hu ) there ha been much talk earlier about minor .
the financi crisi is hit them hardest .
the charter of fundament right insist on this .
minor are entitl to feel safe .
it would be an exercis well worth do .

i would like to ask the commission for a repli .
it servic were use by a wide rang of custom .
the chanc of get money back in this way are neglig .
it is therefor time to do someth about this .

where is this direct ?
mr rede , what are you afraid of ?
what forc are at work here ?
are those forc call murdoch , or someth el ?
so , who control it ?
it is almost exclus the govern polit parti .
we need freedom of the press - and not just in itali !
such sponsor account for up to 68 % of these action .
simpli lost .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
( de ) mr presid , i would like to ask mr mauro someth .
in prepar this debat , i spoke with him a number of time .
( applaus )
( it ) mr presid , i am most grate to mr schulz .
i , too , am not an italian speaker .
it is incred import in this debat to restat that perspect .
i would point out that onli in china do such thing happen .
( the presid call for order )
that is an interest question .
that is my opinion .
it would make the debat overrun .
i am sorri .
excus me if that seem a neglig factor at a time like this .
ala , the titl of today 's debat is itali .
this debat must not give way to dishonesti .
( it ) madam presid , i will tri to be brief .
mr berlusconi is prepar to introduc them .
this is the situat in which we therefor find ourselv .
is it right to ask europ to deal with this problem ?
definit , becaus we in itali are not deal with it .
you champion of freedom of the press against censorship !
the soviet union of journalist .
what fine freedom fighter !
shame on you , coward !
( the presid cut off the speaker )
that is not the problem , howev .
mr daul , when you quot mr napolitano , quot him in full .
i would ask you to reflect on this data .
howev , this is not the issu here .
the answer to that is clear .
the passiv of the commission is deepli disappoint .
freedom of speech is an import fundament right .
this ha been the view voic in the debat so far .
while listen to the debat , two question occur to me .
is the right to free assembl an import fundament right ?
is it a import a fundament right a freedom of speech ?
it certain is .
is it a import a fundament right a freedom of speech ?
it certain is import .
it definit is an import fundament right .
all i ask of you is not to employ doubl standard .
that equat to eur 32 million per year .
this amount to a form of addit financ through the court .
we have heard the inform suppli by our fellow member .
what happen in itali concern u all , howev .
here we are show that fundament freedom are at stake .
itali 's concern are also our own .
do you know to whom this newspap refer ?
one of these is the unit kingdom .
( bg ) thank you , madam presid .
( the presid request silenc in the chamber )
so i think that everybodi can read this and recal it .

they will be the basi for our futur work .
first of all , articl 7 is a veri except provis .
so far , it ha never been activ by the eu institut .
( the presid onc more request silenc )
would legisl solv the problem you all have in mind today ?
could we justifi it under exist eu compet ?
is there a clear cross-bord dimens ?
then the commiss will take that a step forward .
i think , in the end , that is what the parliament want .

i do not believ that that is accept .

there are also data protect problem .
henc , codecis is the right procedur to choos .
the citizen must have access to the result of these evalu .
so that is the first respons .
the treati current in forc do not permit this .
i propos to you that we support the draft resolut .
he call for a global ban on so-cal nake bodi scanner ' .
his colleagu vote against that ban .
it ha also forgotten about it secur provis for these .
i would also like to talk briefli about codecis .
( de ) mr presid , we need a democrat revolut .
that is what we are see at the moment in my countri .
we must not hide behind technic debat .
we need to face up to these challeng .
perhap our relat will becom warmer in the futur .
much remain to be done , howev .
trust between the countri ha , at time , been decid lack .
mistrust , rather than trust , ha typifi relat .
the commiss is right to worri .
i hope you are proud of yourself .
come on , pull the other one : this place is a joke !
and when we fight back , we win .
this , too , is schengen .
for them , schengen mean humili , a wall and a problem .

howev , we are still mile away from that .
it wa , in fact , set up for the good of it citizen .

there is none reflect in the current propos .
the same goe for the domest secur of our member state .
it is someth i would support entri into .
i veri much regret this .
i believ that it give too much power to the commiss .
i now come to parliament .
there is a misunderstand here too .
the evalu will be far more frequent and will be clearer .
those are my thought , madam presid , ladi and gentleman .
i would like to make three final point .
this wa no surpris to me .
in the first place , there can be no breach in consist .
all parti must be involv .
the joint debat is close .
the vote will take place tomorrow .
written statement ( rule 149 )
schengen cooper can take mani differ form .
veri mani applic can be pick out and close scrutinis .
the next item is the joint debat on :
thus , we would be elimin visa requir on both side .

either the whole european area is accept or it is not .
i would simpli like to thank all those who have interven .
this is import to u .
the joint debat is close .
the vote will take place tomorrow .
progress of si ii and vi ( debat )
both of these project are technolog complex .
vi , for it part , ha enter an import phase .
i come first to si ii .
this will give u an opportun to review the issu in detail .
on the other hand , it would seem that the stt is go well .
the test should be conclud on 11 novemb .
signific financi resourc have been har .
we appreci the manner in which he ha done that .
public confid in these system is absolut vital .
and what about the outsourc arrang which are be establish ?
could you tell u what those penalti are ?
what are the estim extra cost envisag ?
we can , i guess , expect some further slippag .
in the summer of 2012 , the olymp are be held in london .
those are a few of the question i would like to ask you .
thank you again for come here .
i would like to use this opportun to underlin our posit .
inde , there are now doubt over the viabil of the project .
what action is be taken to address the shortcom ?
there have been mani problem and delay .
the new system is still not work .
whi do we need si ii ?
this rais a number of question .
how much money ha been paid out on these ground ?
if this is the case , what implic will it have for the vi ?
( de ) thank you madam presid .
i shall tri to keep to my speak time .
the delay need to be relentless analys and investig .
there must also be clear consequ .
we should learn from past experi for the futur .
we are now talk about it be develop perhap over 10 year .
this , therefor , rais sever question .
is the european commiss readi to implement an altern plan ?
will this equip be use in the altern plan ?
first , i am veri grate to all of the speaker .
henc , i am somewhat insist on this point .
i sincer hope that we will have made progress by then .

decis on urgent procedur
this gestur wa one of great attent which we appreci .
these are legitim concern which we agre with in part .
it fail to react in ani way for month a the crisi went on .
no , i do not think that is the right way to proceed .
the commiss talk of restructur .
no , it want to continu pay out export refund .
that simpli can not be allow to happen .
we , too , have respons here , i am happi to accept that .
we must not , howev , give up ani respons .
rather , a parliamentarian , that respons is our call .
( applaus )
i can partial agre with what the previous speaker said .
( applaus )
mr presid , we are at a decis point in time .
negoti are move too slowli , howev .
a number of key issu have not yet been resolv .
this mean that the bid current on the tabl are not enough .
emiss should be cut by at least 80 % by 2050 .
we need to get everyon on board .
climat chang pose a threat to the millennium develop goal .
expert in develop will also take part in the negoti work .
adapt measur are requir in this regard .
the council is awar of the scale of the financ requir .
i am therefor ask you to set the pace .
we have to combin our effort .
we are onli 50 day away from copenhagen .
expect are veri high .
it is now the time for put offer on the tabl .
first , we have made offer in term of commit .
second , offer in term of financ .
but action by the eu alon is not enough .
we count on develop countri a well .
final , a word on the deliveri channel for climat fund .
we a the commiss are not in favour of creat new fund .
one parti say 15 billion , anoth say 30 billion .
let u develop criterion for how the money is use .
enough ha been said about the crisi .
go forward posit !
so , what are we call for ?
for what are we go to do with them ?
my second point concern the method of financ .
we all know that it doe no such thing .
this is therefor not a question of chariti .
i urg you to make the right choic .
without a global agreement , we will go nowher .
this support must be in addit to our oversea develop aid .
there is no doubt that climat chang is acceler .
no further time can be wast .
our scientif approach should not be chang .
we creat it ourselv .
we have no influenc on what the sun doe .
second , a hyster ob with man-mad global warm .
these two theme are intim link .
can you not see the danger in this grow gulf ?
it is time to look at the fact .
the eu ha a vital respons .
in this context , the veri strong work of the eu is vital .
ultim , this is a matter of solidar .
consequ , both oda resourc and new fund will be requir .
it is also a way of rejuven our economi .
i think this is a veri import featur .
this is not simpli a competit .
it is about an engag of the european union .
you can count on our support .
much remain to be done in europ , too , howev .
the commiss 's propos is quit simpli not enough .
natur , this support must be in addit to regular aid .
second , we must take the two degre target serious .
first , the copenhagen confer is a gambl on the futur .
skimp on that object is out of the question .
onc again , this is a time for eu leadership .
special attent is requir for develop countri .
the bali action plan put that well .
they , too , must face up to their respons .
we consid this an essenti area .
combat deforest is the best way of reduc co2 .
we vote against a we consid it to be euro-folli .
without success .
this is , inde , a key matter .
plant tree help to combat desertif .
no new fund , ' say commission de gucht .
the develop countri are now suffer a tripl blow .
inact is a crime against human .
that is total unaccept .
howev , it is europ that hold the key to copenhagen .
the copenhagen summit provid u with an opportun .
let u be clear : we realli have no choic .
so we are all talk here about someth which is not happen .
a pollut !
it is a life-giv natur gas .
is n't this all about polit control ?
is n't this all about polit and big busi ?
enough plea , befor we damag irrevoc the global economi .
now let u consid the hypothes .
there are various scientif opinion on this .
it wa almost a carbon copi speech .
we heard someth about poll .
that is 81 % .
sometim in life you see thing you never forget .
there are grow number of climat refuge .
do you ask them to smile in the face of death ?
this is unjust and ineffect .
that is whi we have to go beyond a mere declar of intent .
the council is talk about eur 100 billion by 2020 .
we need our own resourc , therefor , not just palliat .
this is the fairer option .
( applaus )
these are the realist way of tackl climat chang .
this point ha alreadi been made mani time .
europ must help this come about .
we must , of cours , take account of intellectu properti .
yet this knowledg must be diffus more quick .
i would welcom mr carlgren 's comment on this .
it is a vital and irreplac food for plant life .
the more plant receiv , the faster they grow .
this is creat an aura of despair among coastal communiti .
how are we go to prevent carbon leakag ?
i do still have one specif concern .
we should not exceed the 2 degre celsius mark .
we know about the challeng ahead of u .
a such , we ll face these challeng steadfast and respons .
madam presid , do you know russian roulett ?
have you ever play russian roulett ?
whi are we in this imposs situat ?
now europ need alli , and support for it exist propos .
this must not just be a wish list .
commission , it is good to see you in place .
presid , it is good to see you here .
talk of 2020 or 2050 is not good enough .
we are see the diver of oda budget away from develop .
we have heard the climat chang denier here in this hous .
this mean that in some place there is no water .
there are no tree .
climat chang kill .
it is a simpl a that .
that is eur 30 billion per annum .
we must prevent all distort of competit .
in copenhagen , we need to make a big effort .
develop countri need both type of resourc .
we therefor need to go beyond 0.7 % of gnp .
this wa the messag from the presid of the spanish govern .
at that point , the patient is damag beyond recoveri .
i hope that we all agre on that .
the council and the commiss must do more in this connect .
i have one final word to add .
other region in the world , too , must do more .
that will not be enough , howev .
this also strengthen the fight against climat chang .
addit aid is requir for develop countri .
( fi ) madam presid , certain fact need to be acknowledg .
what we do must be wise and effect .
the world can no longer afford a poor agreement on climat .
dirti product must not be possibl anywher .
howev , we can not limit ourselv to this .
scienc is not a totem .
these are key point .
there are also differ in approach within europ .
the futur lie in a green , liber market economi .
madam presid , success or failur , that is the question ' .
i agre with mr carlgren .
( ro ) we live on a planet with a diver climat .
i think the answer to this is obvious .
that is whi the copenhagen meet is import .
ha no countri in europ given consider to this yet ?
these are veri complex issu .
i , for one , am a believ in technolog .
limit alon will not help u attain our target .
we realli must use these day in the best way possibl .
a global threat call for a global respons .
i would like to thank parliament for it support .
i have no doubt about that .
we also expect the other to come forward .
they have to come forward .
i think we need a frank and open discus in copenhagen .
the debat is close .
written statement ( rule 149 )
china seem unwil to accept bind target .
some say we can not afford such new financ .
our economi will recov , but our environ will not ...
i believ that this problem must be dealt with in two way :
the european decis made recent facilit this .
we must progress further along this road .
we should continu with this way of think .
when make decis , we should also think of the citizen .
everyon know how serious the problem is .
there is a psycholog explan for this inertia .
the onli problem is that we have no time left .

it wa downgrad by some member state .
we are now wait for a respons from the undertak involv .
there either are or there are not .
mr verhofstadt , let u be clear .
these are the three stumbl block .
i have good news for all of you .
for 2009 a a whole , that would repres a 4 % decreas .
is that your idea of a social europ ?
so we are say that we should keep the stimulus programm .
this is also a question of solidar with futur generat .
a chanc to hold the execut to account sure must be welcom .
so you have almost got your treati .
toni blair is the odds-on favourit with the bookmak .
inde , wa this the deal that i predict back in 2005 ?
wa this agre all along ?
it wa not a great result - just 67 % of the peopl !
( applaus )
that is a decis for the european council .
if there were , i would alreadi know .
so there are no hidden agreement or secret bargain .
you could have democratis the eu with this treati .
you chose not to .
that is precis the logic of it .
so i feel i have strong democrat legitimaci .
( applaus )
if not , i have been misinform .
so we have a system of human right .
thank you veri much , mr presid .
i would also like to thank mr barroso .
we must keep to time if we are to have a live debat .
so thank you veri much , everyon .
consequ of the financi crisi on employ and social cohes

we are link those two issu .
our object is to strengthen social cohes .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
that is 16 % of all new job .
the most affect categori are young peopl and migrant .
i think this should be our actual target .
this is a veri import polici a well .
we put this on the council tabl , but it wa reject .
that repres about eur 3 500 billion more !
second , whi do we keep meet in strasbourg ?
regard the issu of be care and rigor , i agre with you .
except measur were need for what wa an unpreced situat .
it is a question , a alway , of balanc in judgment .
they say that the european union is to blame .
i would therefor like to ask a question .
this regul wa formul befor the crisi .
how can we link these strategi that are avail to u ?
with regard to the tool , i will cite just one exampl .
what are your propos ?
i therefor sent this letter onli today .
i alreadi announc the main innov dure my debat with you .
this is veri import .
that is where we can creat new product , new market .
this is a good exampl .
there are three thing that i would like to call for .
what happen to them ?
we are make avail some best practic .
in other word , we have to invest in other polici .
we need to do the opposit of what ha been done so far .
mr barroso , the financi crisi in the uk is veri serious .
one of the mani sector struggl is the agricultur sector .
the equip use to scan the sheep is not accur .
i have been told it is onli 79 % accur .
that is a veri specif question .
i do not think it is in veri good tast , realli .
( applaus )
let u see how it work in practic .
we have to do more for smes ; i think it is a prioriti .
we have approv the small busi act ; that is good .
there may be some more ; i am work on it .
i realli enjoy it .
i think it is a good exercis .
anyway , you decid the format .
( applaus )
that conclud the item .
the next item is the joint debat on the follow :
section i - european parliament
section ii - council
section iv - court of justic
section v - court of auditor
section vi - european econom and social committe
section vii - committe of the region
section viii - european ombudsman
section ix - european data protect supervisor
( c7-0128/2009 - .
is the european union abl to respond to this ?
is it abl to protect the eu 's border ?
is it welcom refuge with an equit approach ?
there are no major differ divid polit group .
what doe all this mean in actual figur ?
howev , there is also an even bigger concern .
therefor , rais the payment level is an absolut must .
it goe without say we will have debat on this .
howev , we will agre on the most import matter .
thank you for your respect attent .
the budget for 2010 establish this systemat approach .
we have a common pot of fund .
major issu remain .
it want financ for administr !
we will need to resolv the complex dairi issu .
have said that , i do note some posit element .
i see that the baltic sea strategi got some extra money .
we will need to provid the necessari fund for that .
eleven million child die everi year in the develop world .
all i want u to do is to meet our commit to these peopl .
i will present three of them to you in one minut .
this is therefor someth new compar to the 2009 budget .
there are two thing that we must impress on the commiss .
you see , it is the same everi time .
in 15 year ' time , they will account for 34 % .
this is orwellian newspeak and it is unaccept .
we need more resourc to be alloc to research and develop .
we must work togeth to reduc bureaucraci .
nonetheless , this is actual too littl at this time .
the situat on the agricultur market is drastic .
the commiss ha put it hope in self-regul for far too long .
whi are you cut back on that ?
unfortun , the situat is much more serious than this .
the institut current ha just a director and an assist .
howev , i should like to issu a warn .
this is the case with the recoveri plan .
other matter also deserv special attent .
we support the draft budget put forward by mr surján .
we have been call for this for a long time .
now we may final see it laid on the tabl .
i will now turn to the argument about the dairi farmer .
we also want to redistribut money .
my final comment is on the recoveri plan .
that is what we expect from the negoti over the come week .
here , howev , we will be look at the budget .
it is a business-as-usu budget .
we do not need drop of water in sea of milk .
what we need is anoth polici for rural area .
what we realli need is courag !
i have made propos about travel expens .
this is ridicul and incomprehens .
it can also be seen in the explod unemploy figur .
they fear for their job and they fear for their pension .
europ wa a guarante for peac and prosper for a long time .
( fr ) we are europ .
i will ensur that everyth that is said is pas on to me .
it ha been a good debat .
mani good suggest have been made .
it is difficult to set prioriti , but set them we must .
that is not someth we can ignor .
one of the result of the crisi is unemploy .
our goal is excel in lawmak .
in practic , this refer to the execut of the eu budget .
i consid the critic absurd for a number of reason .
instead , larg sum are repaid to the member state a rebat .
we are prepar to fight for this .
there will be no net contribut to the baltic sea strategi .
it is an import contribut .
this is what our elector charg u with six month ago .
the european union decid on new focal area in it budget .
the figur for 2008 came out on 23 septemb .
this is term solidar ' , but it is theft , pure and simpl .
howev , the new power will also mean new respons .
i am go to mention two of them .
first , the fund of the european econom recoveri plan .
this is a disgrac .
we have not yet been abl to find a solut .
the second matter is the dairi fund .
we play our part in attain that .
the second reserv relat to the financi regul .
thank you veri much , mr gräßle .
that make it much easier to answer afterward .
this is the citizen-focus polici i refer to .
for my part , i want to mention just one special matter .
i think member should resist all this .
this ha evok remark and reserv from some politician .
such remark have also been heard dure the debat .
i would therefor ask for more inform on the subject .
these are my brief remark regard the discus .
thank you veri much , commission šemeta .
they would certain appreci that enorm .
i total agre with his statement that there is a problem .
there is also a great deal of consensus on the object .
i do not think that this is what the issu is about here .
my time ha run out .
thank you for your respect attent .
i would like to thank the shadow rapporteur and coordin .
that bring the joint debat to a close .
the vote will take place on thursday at 11.00 .
written statement ( rule 149 )
greater financi support for structur and cohes polici ;
a develop programm for portugues industri ;
a programm for support the textil and cloth industri ;
an increas in fund for the life+ programm .
we would all like to see a larger financi alloc .
democraci build in extern relat ( debat )
i would also like to say that democraci can not be export .
it is no product for export .
in my view , we can not accept this situat in the futur .
it also need more resourc .
the effort made up to that point had been larg inadequ .
poverti mean an absenc of power , opportun and secur .
it is difficult to have peac without democraci .
consequ , there can be no develop without peac .
both requir full respect for human right .
that is undisput .
we are not start from scratch .
we have alreadi achiev a great deal .
certain , there is substanti room for improv , howev .
we can do more .
we can do better .
this is undermin the impact of what we are do .
how can we do this ?
we can draw inspir from some of our success stori .
our involv in the western balkan is one such exampl .
that is whi it is becom a stabl environ for democraci .
we must be humbl , howev .
we face substanti challeng in the region .
i want to make myself clear .
natur , this is a sensit issu .
where are we now ?
they must be fulli involv in the eu 's activ .
eu support for democraci build is incred import .
madam presid , how can one bring democraci to a nation ?
europ must therefor assum it role a a soft power .
this is a thankless , difficult role .
it is fragil but promis , if taken great care of .
mr presid , can there be democraci without freedom ?
can there be freedom without right ?
of cours not .
poverti is therefor synonym with a lack of freedom .
it mean support a civilian surg .
develop in georgia and moldova rais most concern .
in other word , what is in the pipelin ?
member state often have veri conflict and differ aspir .
how can we pursu a common polici like this ?
how can we rid ourselv of these doubl standard ?
recess result in dissatisfact and social unrest .
we are work intens on this .
mr hautala brought up the issu of uzbekistan .
this is , of cours , a veri serious matter .
the human right situat there is far from satisfactori .
at present , the council is not unanim .
shortcom exist .

that is posit discrimin .
what we need is concret financi action .
that conclud question time .
i look forward to hear your comment .
that said , it is alway better than do noth at all .
if it prove it worth , we will then agre to an extens .
commission , you have inde larg accommod parliament .
i know that you do not have ani more money avail to you .
is that whi you requir the power ?
the commiss must now bear the overal respons again .
mani have been under financi pressur for a long time .
i think that is the challeng .
howev , i remain unconvinc by the buy-out scheme .
we must do this to protect the industri .
howev , i have three question to ask .
the first one is a follow .
what do you see a the lesson from this crisi ?
have we learnt ani lesson from it ?
look at the futur , what can you promis farmer ?
how will they avoid a similar crisi in the futur ?
i would like to hear a clear-cut , detail answer from you .
now for my next question .
what doe this mean exact ?
these farmer have end up in the direst situat .
how and when will this injustic and inequ be elimin ?
i think this is an unaccept discrep .
howev , such crise recur again and again .
perhap it will not be dairi next time .
perhap it will be cereal , or someth el .
i have more question for the commission .
i stand by that view .
so what do you mean by restructur ?
this polici is no longer an effect mean to an end .
( fr ) mr presid , there ha to be consist in polit .
that is not the issu at stake this even , howev .
we demand common , european solut .
i therefor reject this amend .
i therefor reject this amend .
at present , there are two approach .
these two approach contradict each other .
( the presid ask the speaker to speak more slowli )
i firm believ this .
how should we handl the overal situat ?
commission , support the dairi fund !
i wa veri plea about it .
i feel i must reject ani measur that restrict balanc out .
our farmer do not want to be constant subsidis .
that is most import .
let u look at the lesson .
this is the wrong approach .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
i am sure that is not what we want .
ok , you have chosen your path and follow it consist .
noth could be more wrong .
this wa one part of the discus .
so it is not a blank chequ .
then i think there are lot of mistaken idea go round .
this eur 280 million is not for restructur .
so it is not restructur .
how should it be distribut ?
i have clear said it ha to be on the basi of product .
i will repli to some of the specif question .
that is not the best imag for european agricultur .
i notic veri care how it wa done .
it wa quit smart , i would say .
( applaus )
that conclud this item .
the vote will take place on thursday .
written statement ( rule 149 )
unfortun , the commiss ha taken a long time to act .

militari solut alon can never lead to a sustain solut .
( applaus )
i know that this parliament is fulli commit to this work .
we must carri forward the work we agre at the g20 .
we must push on with our programm to address energi secur .
there are le than 50 day to go to copenhagen .
progress in the negoti remain slow .
the copenhagen agenda is not just about climat chang .
the lisbon treati is the first treati of the enlarg europ .
institut alon , howev , are not enough .
( applaus )
of cours , we will respect that decis , whatev it may be .
we can well see that current , we are in a stalem .
moder and polit pressur or maximum pressur ?
( applaus )
we need bind object , not general statement .
that is absolut essenti .
it is also about introduc new measur to stimul employ .
now i would like to say someth about lisbon .
the major opinion at the time wa that they did not .
we must make our opinion quit clear in this regard .
( protest )
that is veri import .
we need a council presid who can work with u effect .
i know that we must find a compromis .
( applaus )
mr swoboda , could you comment on that ?
the futur is not about the beneš decre .
that is my vision of europ .
i hope day , not week .
if you wait , he will wait .
if you go forward , he will sign .
that is my opinion .
my second point is about the extern action servic .
that is all i have to say on presid klaus .
( applaus )
i believ that this must be taken serious .
instead , it is one of the major block to progress .
the financ for this intern fund must be transpar .
the object is to reduc co2 emiss by 30 % by 2020 .
colleagu , plea keep to the allot time .
and institut chang do not help with climat chang .
the bank have , of cours , been rescu .
that would be much more appropri .
this did not just relat to the social progress claus .
that is not true .
( protest )
( protest )
i certain would .
is it go to be toni blair with his empress cheri ?
well i have reach the conclus that i want toni blair .
so plea appoint toni blair .
i would first like to address mr verhofstadt .
this is extrem import .
mr daul , we have veri intens contact with other player .
peopl all over the world are expect u to do so .
institut issu are extrem import .
so , what do we do in this case ?
i believ success is still possibl in copenhagen .
there are also posit aspect .
the unit state ha re-ent the negoti .
my final point is to express my surpris .
( applaus )
let u be clear .
the british govern ha negoti the treati .
the british govern ha sign the treati .
her majesti the queen ha ratifi the treati .
the instrument of ratif of the uk are deposit in rome .
( applaus )
my second point concern supervis of the financi market .
we must go further .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
this appli also to the european extern action servic .
furthermor , we need intern burden-shar within the eu .
( fr ) mr presid , i would like to ask three question .
first , there is the issu of climat chang .
each countri must agre to make an appropri financi effort .
if we can not demonstr solidar , this will not work .
my second point concern the issu of migrat .
final , the third issu is foreign polici .
so much the better !
we are probabl go to have a high repres .
so much the better !
they must propos a strategi that is not exclus militari .
if we do not do this , no one el will .
europ is a communiti base on law , a democraci .
it is not a bazaar .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
i would now like to return to my own topic .
these differ are appar here in parliament a well .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
the european union began it recoveri veri well .
we should thank the commiss for that .
the object must be the regul of the financi market .
these are not new subject .
for that reason , i am speak today in italian .
peopl want the referendum that they were promis .
more than ten year of debat among the institut are enough .
land regul are exclus a matter of nation author .
in this context , i would like to make anoth comment .
the necessari safeguard must be put in place .
the european union must not play this dishonour game .
that is absurd .
we need to have extra financ .
now the banker will onc again be receiv record salari .
who will repres the eu now ?
there is certain to be chao .
my third comment , mr presid , is a follow .
that can not be allow to happen !
so i say to my euroscept friend : get over it ' .
that is democrat legitimaci .
so let u deal with the real world .
of cours , we are all concern about the czech republ .
if we hit out at him , it could well be counterproduct .
sustain is a sourc of technolog develop .
this bring me to my third point : the econom crisi .
we want a citizen ' europ .
final , the approach to the asylum issu .
this is what i believ we are lack .
anoth point i would like to discus is the ankara protocol .
what are we go to do ?
the deadlin is 1 novemb .
what action are we go to take ?
the first point i would like to rais concern the climat .
this mean that pragmat and result must take preced .
my second point concern the financi market .
i would like to highlight the import of two thing .
i think that this is not the right solut .
the exist budget line need some money and some credibl .
( pt ) i would like to make two brief point .
my second point is about the copenhagen confer .
we need a sen of ambit if we are to save the planet .
proper organis migrat can benefit all of the parti involv .
( c ) mr presid , the lisbon treati is a key issu .
i doubt , howev , that the presid will end his obstruct .
the damag is not inconsider .
the czech medium are nonetheless seeth with doubt .
what is realli go on in the czech republ ?
( el ) mr presid , my speech will concentr on three point .
first point : the econom crisi .
it is also clear that econom risk need to be europeanis .
trust is good , control is even better .
second point : climat chang .
the ecolog debt burden everyon without except .
third point : immigr .
howev , there are also foreign polici aspect to immigr .
i wish to say quit clear that turkey 's stanc is provoc .
i wa plea to hear the swedish presid point that out .
we need more industri to shoulder the burden .
i am refer to the air transport and ship industri .
in all modesti , i would like to make a suggest .
plea ask the commiss presid to take a look at this issu .
i am sure both of you and mani here share that view .
what is your opinion about gazpromian ' for the presid ?
everi countri ha the right to declar reserv .
mr malmström , what are these legal measur ?
could you provid u with this inform ?
therefor , i think that this would be a danger preced .
second , it is wrong to cite the irish a an exampl .
howev , we know that this issu is absolut central .
whi do we not refer to a structur crisi ?
( fr ) mr presid , my question is veri simpl .
( ro ) mr presid , my name is luhan , not luman .
that is what we are here to do .
we may each have differ view on the treati of lisbon .
there is still no solut with regard to the czech presid .
a few question have been ask about afghanistan .
that is veri soon .
howev , i do agre with you that it is import .
they also concern solidar and recept system .
we will then take further decis in decemb .
mr van baalen , the issu of the ankara protocol is import .
therefor , i will certain return to this issu again .
the same appli with regard to the 18 extra mep .
it may , therefor , take some time .
i hope that the prepar get underway a soon a possibl .
their decis or delay will have an impact on all .
but i would say that we are face a real challeng here .
we heard this particular theme evok often dure the debat .
anoth issu rais concern the administr burden .
we hope parliament will give it support to this .
it ha been criticis by mani a not be enough .
the debat is close .
written statement ( rule 149 )
it is easi to understand whi .
they are mr blair 's .
i share the revuls of those oppos to mr blair 's presid .
mr blair brought britain to the edg of ruin .
he could do the same for the eu .
the eu and toni blair deserv each other .
it is import to keep an ambiti negoti posit .
i would like to highlight one exampl : energi secur .
( the sit wa suspend for a few minut )
it seem pretti clear who is attack freedom of opinion .
he ha base his analysi on the follow principl .
thus , the presid ha decid that they are admiss .
natur , we will vote against those amend .

this is the first thing i wish to say .
those were probabl fact .
my first two vote are abstent from the whole day 's vote .
( sv ) itali is part of the european cradl of democraci .
how this is achiev is not a matter for the eu .
the italian themselv must take action on this .
onli then can europ gain the confid of the elector .
we need to ensur that this is also the case in the futur .
this left-w hypocrisi is abhorr .
i hold no particular brief for silvio berlusconi .
pactio olisipiensi censenda est !
but there is a veri import principl here .
do you know what we say in itali ?
written explan of vote
we have alway been consist .
we wholeheart support such a debat .
henc , i have vote against the resolut .
freedom of the press is essenti in a democrat societi .
this unfortun pattern of behaviour persist .
this is becaus that govern is dislik by the left .
the left is free to dislik the italian govern .
this time i could not do so .
no , this is in franc !
howev , this is not a problem which is specif to itali .
this ha caus signific controversi in franc .
freedom of the press is an absolut requir .
howev , it repres ha not shown himself worthi of it today .
if peopl think owner do not influenc newspap think again .
onli a minor of those had an anti-war stanc on iraq .
democraci depend on the public be inform .
it is with regret that colleagu on the right differ .
i am veri plea with the outcom of the vote .
correct to vote and vote intent : see minut
approv of the minut of the previous sit : see minut
( applaus )
this is clear laid down in the treati of lisbon .
this is rough a far a we have got in the discus .
mr brok 's report recognis this great potenti .
first , let me mention the status of the eea .
inde it will be sui generi a there is no model to follow .
we are build someth new .
this should be our object .
this veri much meet the wish express in the report .
they will be equal in everi sen .
in most place , this procedur will go quit smooth .
it will , a your report say , evolv over time .
we will learn togeth .
but we need to look further .
for this , train is essenti .
these are matter for the futur .
this report show that parliament will do the same .
plea forgiv me , mr presid .
it is a veri import topic .
the main thing is to adopt the report now .
we should act a guardian of the public purs .
this propos is uncost .
the gue/ngl group is oppos to this .
some of our request aim to produc the same result .
that is pretti easi : democraci , democraci and democraci .
this parliament is base sole on krato - pure on power .
it is never ever base on demo .
we must , therefor , have more democraci .
for that reason , this report must be reject .
not , i think , the council .
that ha to act unanim .
what about the parliament ?
no , that is limit to consult .
we are well awar that this report is not a definit report .
my speak time ha run out .
the budgetari commiss is extrem import .
it is a lever with which the ep can exercis it power .
we should not forget about the human factor either .
i digress .
i am absolut delight about this .
simpli have attend a diplomaci colleg is not enough .
but how will that role develop ?
where will it limit be ?
in fact , quit the opposit is the case .
therefor , we do not share this philosophi .
we believ that there is a lack of control .
they will be those of the european commiss .
all other nation embassi will becom redund .
they are creat a new yugoslavia .
i saw what happen when democraci fail .
it is not pretti .
now i see democraci fail here in europ .
( de ) mr presid , the council 's action are not transpar .
my respons is a clear no ' .
this must not happen !
howev , you are in favour of this treati .
realli interest .
that is whi they have to enjoy the same status .
we have fail so far to ensur that our polici are coher .
the extern servic must be wholli in step with the commiss .
to deni that would be naiv .
what is the reason for this posit ?
the question of coher is central in this context .
consist is pivot in this connect .
it is a two-way process .
that is sui generi .
this generat a lot of heat , but not much movement .
the citizen of europ want europ to speak with one voic .
peopl outsid europ expect this .
the eea will not be abl to achiev this on it own .
howev , it repres a step in the right direct .
let u make sure that it work .
what will happen to these ministri ?
will they dissolv ?
that seem unlik .
we ought to draw on this experi .
i have in mind bruge , natolin , florenc and maastricht .
i would also like to emphasis the issu of recruit .
on this note , i would like to point out two thing .
thank you for your question .
this is what i should have address first .
this is outrag !
we in the european parliament must pay attent .
i believ that this is an open question .
it seem to me that there is a real risk of that happen .
mr brok 's report also mention train .
a state ha an anthem and a flag , cooper doe not .
we also hear about europ speak with one voic .
do you believ it is a state ?
( laughter and applaus )
this would allow europ to truli speak with one voic .
this is extrem import .
are appropri prepar be made in this regard ?
( applaus )
that is a good thing .
it is sui generi so we have to find way to develop it .
i am quit convinc of that .
of cours , there are still issu to be resolv .
i hope it will get broad support in this parliament .
the situat should be the same in the futur .
the statement that you have made belong to the past .
oper foreign polici must be the respons of the execut .
this is the case in all nation state .
i believ that some action must be taken here .
this must also be taken into account .
( applaus )
the debat is close .
the vote will take place on thursday , 22 octob 2009 .
written statement ( rule 149 )

the list of area of cooper is a long one .
final , i would like to mention three more point .
this is extrem import .
my second point relat to critic infrastructur .
that could have devast consequ .
there is huge scope for cooper in this area .
this cooper must be improv .
we also need to coordin our technic assist better .
that is also what our friend in washington expect .
but let u be also clear .
vice-presid barrot will repres the commiss .
this involv , in particular , the question of the legisl .
it is essenti that copenhagen is a success .
we must all ensur that copenhagen is a success .
it is import that we talk to the u from a posit of equal .
i would like an answer on that .
presid obama want to act , but he is block by his major .
this is our respons .
we must do it befor the summit .
we must be unit in defenc of our secur .
ha it been confirm ?
we can , and should , undertak mani thing togeth .
this is the right time to undertak such action .
the tec must be more ambiti .
three quick point .
it is actual a major open .
the studi wa paid for by parliament .
i am hope for good result in this respect next week .
peac in the middl east ?
peac in afghanistan ?
that , at least , is the view of my group .
howev , we should not pretend to agre on everyth .
we need to defend atlantic here , too .
it ought to be develop .
first of all , howev , trade is not realli in danger .
madam presid , i have a coupl of point .
it is a veri small oper , a we know .
i will be there next tuesday , commission .
we want to be amongst the leader for chang .
we need to be the impetus for this chang .
i think we should concentr on two area .
the first area concern financi and econom matter .
the second area is secur .
i believ that intern trade is a decis factor .
europ must hold it own in this .
this is a key issu in the eu-us summit 's success .
the econom partnership is a particular import forum for u .
there were a few specif question for me .
i want to be clear on that .
this is the object that we have .
it would be import in guid futur work for the tec .
the agenda will complement each other .
you can imagin that we do not want it .
a last answer on terror .
the need to ensur respect for fundament right is essenti .
you can see that there is an enorm rang of issu .
the debat is close .
the vote will take place on thursday , 22 octob 2009 .
written statement ( rule 149 )
the transatlant econom council ha done good work so far .
the role of legisl in this relationship will be import .

on this occas , a machin can not replac me .
( parliament reject the propos )
( the order of busi wa thus establish )
( the sit wa suspend at 16.05 and resum at 16.15 )
we were in constant contact with pragu and other capit .
let me point out the highlight .
let there be no illus .
the year 2020 is onli 10 year away .
our uniti gave u the credibl to encourag other .
we were abl to present our commit .
we were abl to express our expect .
it is up to u to chang this trend .
it still is .
we also discus justic and home affair .
they were , of cours , an import element of the discus .
the european council also ass other treati prepar .
now to the question of name .
we need to fill the posit creat by the lisbon treati .
we need , togeth with you , to appoint a new commiss .
nevertheless , you and i know that much remain to be done .
i can promis you that the come week will be veri busi .
the copenhagen meet is actual now onli 25 day away .
i am grate for the continu support from this parliament .
i look forward to respond to your comment .
we all know these are difficult issu .
the same is true of other , like china .
so what are the prospect for copenhagen ?
in the end , it is content that matter more than form .
in fact , the commiss is work on it implement .
but now we have to complet the task of transit .
that is obvious also true for the high repres .
this bring me to the commiss a a whole .
then it will be for me to decid on portfolio .
that bring me back to the begin of our afternoon .
we need to rekindl this flame .
we need to have the spirit of 1989 .
my thank to mr reinfeldt .
onc again , what do our fellow citizen want ?
a polit agreement will not suffic in copenhagen .
what count are the quantifi commit made by the state .
the two are link .
we now need to take decis with regard to peopl .
i do not envi you this task , mr reinfeldt .
is that the imag that repres europ to it peopl today ?
the presid of parliament ha alreadi mention this .
you mention the high repres .
there is also the debat about the financi transact tax .
we need to send out clear signal in this regard .
they are specul in the name of god , to put it blunt .
noth el is realli be done transpar , i must say !
this is absolut necessari .
after all , to be elect pope , one ha to be a cathol !
everyon know that , even at an intern level .
mr havel also receiv a great deal of applaus for this .
this caus me serious concern .
the greatest challeng face the world is climat chang .
howev , it is rather differ for the new high repres .
that is actual what ha been put into the treati .
it is a much lengthier process than anyon could forese .
that is what we have been tri to do .
there were comment on who is take this decis .
it take a littl while just to consult everyon .
we are now eu-27 .
this reflect the view of mani of my colleagu .
we have mani exampl of that .
that is the tough thing with this .
first of all , regard climat chang , let u be clear .
the european union is commit to a bind treati .
i believ it is still possibl , and we will fight for it .
i believ that it is a mistak to act in that way .
if we do not have institut that work , what will happen ?
is that what we want ?
i do not think so .
thank you , mr reinfeldt ; thank you , cecilia .
whi must the presid of the council be a prime minist ?
what promis is the council make , then ?
in my view , this is an anticlimax .
i think this is worri .
his posit is bad design from a democrat point of view .
i think that is absolut right .
to mr reinfeldt i would like to say :
this is a danger that we must guard against .
the issu of the nomin is veri import .
my view is that these obstacl can not be free of charg .
onli the presid of the commiss ha full legitimaci .
that is not the spirit of the treati .
we should be happi about it .
a treati , howev , is not enough .
we need inspir and compet peopl to enhanc it .
therefor , unavoid , it ha a lot of ambigu and gap .
( fi ) mr presid , permit me to thank the medium for onc .
yet my sceptic about this project is undiminish .
my fellow member can not fail to share my opinion .
howev , we must seiz this opportun !
ani form of opt-out weaken the communiti .
what do we need ?
plea tell mr barroso this , on my behalf .
the second challeng is that of green growth .
this is also mention in this document .
we must improv our coordin method .
in fact , we need more effect tool .
it is our share respons to highlight this fact .
it is exact the same with the climat packag .
it must take a real initi in copenhagen .

we are oblig to help kosovo to meet the benchmark .
it can not do it alon .
visa-fre travel is a deepli humanitarian act .
i am plea that we were all in a posit to make this happen .

written statement ( rule 149 )
it is also a veri definit polit matter .
visa-fre travel is base on mutual trust and commit .
we receiv such assist from the eu and the imf .
the approach , a you see , wa an egalitarian one .
the latvian situat is not uniqu in the union .
hungari and romania have also receiv communiti loan .
other countri may one day be forc to appli for such loan .
million of peopl have lost their job .
whi have these three countri had to ask for assist ?
whi have we had to lend them money ?
how are we help them ?
the european union doe not make fund avail without condit .
we have been ask to trust member state .
peopl have the smallest reserv then in these countri .
that ha been said a coupl of time alreadi .
i fear that is not what is happen .
but that is not what we are get .
they are set out to destroy our educ system .
we are fulli in agreement with them .
that is the problem .
what is our altern , then , a repres of european citizen ?

that is the situat .

howev , the polit crisi ha disrupt the negoti process .
let u not allow ourselv to be blind by our ideolog prefer .
what ha happen , though ?
that hope is now dead .
the elect of 29 novemb can not be recognis .
we reject ani agreement with an illeg govern .
the gsp+ agreement must be suspend .
we talk about elect becaus elect are democraci .
we have had exampl of this in europ in the past .
the elect in poland in 1989 are an exampl .
they were not democrat elect .
they were decis , specif and veri import .
i am sure that we want this to happen .
the elect can be decis and posit for a democrat hondura .
the elect are an opportun for chang .
i condemn this militari coup in the strongest term .
no elect have been held there for 50 year .
we must make fresh urgent call for peac and dialogu .

it is not about protection .
this happen all over the world .
specif , mr schlyter ask me about the expand of the list .
mr arif said that we should not water this down .
we are look at the whole eurom issu a well .
they go hand in hand .
it is about the level play field .

i do not see this a particular strang .
such figur need to be brought down by all institut .
my last point is about communic in practic .

the third problem is subsidiar .

the commiss will now carri out that posit .
if it need clarif , it is down to the commiss to do that .
this is an import step forward for consum .
mr presid , the telecom packag will be decid on tomorrow .
this could open the way for arbitrari measur .
the result is someth of which parliament can be proud .
an import decis ha been made .
here , too , an import prerequisit ha been met .
this is an amend that could not be foreseen at the begin .

written statement ( rule 149 )
sinc then , the area ha progress dramat .
τhe next item is the joint debat on the follow report :
i will read his view a rapporteur to you .

of cours , we support the develop of europol .
we want a strong europol .
what is more , there is everi reason to do so .
that is precis what eu citizen now expect from u .
that is all for the moment .
the evalu also consid the possibl of disband the network .
this is a veri serious matter .
unfortun , this ha not happen .
the treati of lisbon is just about to enter into forc .
i now come to the matter of forens laboratori .
again , i am awar of the problem with the legal basi .
natur , we believ that crime must be prevent .
prevent is vital , be it at local or cross-bord level .
the commiss is awar of these .
furthermor , polic cooper now come under codecis .
i refer here to our framework for forens laboratori .
that appli equal to suspect and victim .
that is the realiti : we have a problem .
we would like to reform these provis here .
i think that it is good for europol to work with them .
that is all , noth further .
we therefor all agre on that point .
such is the case in spain .
this will probabl also be the case at eu level .
thank you , mr vice-presid .
i am sure that they will be taken into account .
perhap one should bear these thought in mind .
rather , we want to take part in the decision-mak process .
that is the crucial point , in term of our vote .
we need this in order to success combat terror and crime .
i am think , for instanc , of mafia crime .
it would be veri difficult to interrupt europol 's work .
it would be a shame to somehow interrupt europol 's work .
it is a posit result and a step forward .
of cours !
i just want to make a coupl of point .
i agre total with sophia in 't veld .
there is no way that can be held to be accept .
that is the realiti a far a i see it .
it ha to becom an agenc by 1 januari .
it is not about the european parliament be sidelin .
it is not even about the nation parliament be sidelin .
we should , howev , consid what is least defin .
we should ask ourselv what is most uncertain .
this is the 'a ' in this abc , mr presid .
this is not reason .
we will put question to the council tomorrow .
this propos wa not present .
i would like to thank the rapporteur for their work .

other propos for amend must be discus in greater depth .
we will have suffici time to do so in this hous .

everyth could be discus .

in other word , we must go beyond 2° celsius .
spain , australia and norway have improv their commit .
within this framework , fund is a decis factor .
it wa so interest that it wa not possibl to stop it !
the clock is tick .
presid obama is not yet abl to keep his elect promis .
we are your alli .
europ must take it fair share of this respons .
yet what we are propos is also realist .
mr wortmann-kool ha alreadi mention the kick-start .
we need eur 5 to 7 billion straight away .
it concern the futur of the entir human race .
eu leadership is now crucial import , a befor .
( applaus )
this type of approach is extrem short-sight .
someon ask about the practic side .
the eu ha shown the way here .
some peopl are say go 10 % further .
and , of cours , this must be science-bas .
for the 30 % reduct , i have to add the follow .
it is not onli green industri that we have , of cours .
that is a disast .
nor do i want it to deliv it .
we therefor need to develop a complet differ focus .
that is my appeal .
you can see it with the nake eye .
that is an indic of the urgenc of what we are deal with .
and that is befor the effect of climat chang realli hit u .
i think that is someth that is lack in the public debat .
i know that this is not the fault of these two gentleman .
it will not lead to our industri becom uncompetit .
it is not a faith .
we have to ensur that our scienc is put to the fore .
the ambit could not have been reinforc more strong .
we have 65 head of govern attend .
we are delight with this .
the question is : is it enough ?
the situat is fluid .
we have four week and negoti have a momentum of their own .
are we give you enough room for manoeuvr ?
now , is this a shift in our negoti posit ?
are we strengthen this ?
the scienc is clear .
this is essenti for our climat .
we need to give this some care thought .
i should like to give an exampl .
emiss trade also ha mani disadvantag .
what should we do , then ?
this hous need a realiti check .
she is aliv ( rememb that one ! )
she took a shower .

she had her laptop on the whole day .
we can not leav it at a pathet pittanc .
our amend are concern with three point .
everyon doe not agre .
we must be care to avoid fall into that trap .
we should approach the confer with optim but also realism .
there is no room for doubt there .
mr florenz mention borneo .
howev , he is still veri much alon .
that is unaccept .
let their journey not be in vain .
let them becom awar of their great respons .
that is not accept , that is not serious .
usd 100 billion will be need everi year from 2010 to 2050 .
it is an absolut disgrac .
on the contrari , optim is base on acknowledg realiti .
what should we do in copenhagen , essenti ?
this would also make our economi more competit .
this should be our guid at all time .
commission dima , i want to thank you .
we will see you in copenhagen .
if my inform is correct , it is a follow .
environment action is onli possibl in a healthi economi .
thing will not go well with the present target percentag .
support for the left is melt away faster than the iceberg .
when it come to technolog , we must remain imparti .
we need commit and we need supervis .
in conclus , i wish to send out a clear messag .
we have to act and we have to do so immedi .
( nl ) i should like to discus the transport aspect .
i think that we can go even further in this regard .
let u aim for this .
an agreement is a good thing .
achiev success , of cours , is even better .
that is the messag the eu must champion .
so my messag to you is : plea , be more ambiti .
let u consid whi it will not be a success .
we must take this into account .
what a giveaway that wa !
mayb it is not just certain cow that have gone mad .
i am on the committe on intern trade .
i am deepli concern with the wto talk start this week .
this is just enviro-imperi .
there is a clear remit for what is to be achiev .
what can we shrewd achiev ?
what are the consequ , includ for european industri ?
we need to also take that into account .
anoth member also point out that our contribut is 10 % .
we have done a great deal in europ .
it is not enough .
we need action on a global scale .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
first of all , kyoto wa a failur .
it wa veri symbol , but deliv no reduct in emiss .
third , polit must take note of a debat emerg in scienc .
i therefor call for a chang of strategi .
this is whi educ work is also so import .
europ must not be naiv with regard to china and india .
copenhagen must halt this temperatur increas .
we need to go further than that .
mani transport firm are also global player .
what that mean is that climat protect doe cost money .
rail transport ha been mention .
we must push on with our activ in this regard .
we need to adopt this resolut , which ha three nobl aspir .
let u not give in too quick to pessim .
we must now turn our rhetor into genuin polit will .

the point about fund is simpl .
time is move on and there will be no second chanc .
this is the time it must be done .
this is a key part of our concern .
let me say someth about nuclear power .
nuclear power is definit not the solut to the problem .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
we should also set an exampl .
the eu ha succeed in reduc emiss .
it will not happen straight away in copenhagen .
that is sometim call into question .
that is whi the eu ha set the bar so high .
it would be cynic , then , not to take veri forc action .

veri possibl certain peopl do not agre .

we are read and hear rumour that are rather danger .
let u be clear , there is alway pressur , a you know .
we all have demand made of u .
i have work hard to obtain a fair strong consensus .
a week ago , onli three woman were prospect candid .
you are quit right .
i would veri much like to achiev that .
unfortun , it is not provid for by the treati .
i agre with your fellow member , mr verhofstadt .
ideal , we would have a commiss that is even more balanc .
we do , truli , think that europ need a common market .
we would like to pay tribut to that achiev .
that , of cours , will alway be the case .
there is also talk of lightweight and heavyweight .
mani a heavyweight one day is a lightweight the next .
the social consequ , especi , are give u lot to deal with .
the number of crisi victim is go through the roof .
in the develop world , the consequ are much wors .
this is the first thing .
that is the second thing .
whi did you wait until after the german elect ?
there is no problem about that .
but the ball now is clear in gm 's court .
we can not act on supposit .
your oral dialogu is also at issu though , of cours .
i am sure that we can come to an arrang in this regard .
it wa a veri clever move to conven the summit yesterday .
what conclus have you drawn from it ?
i would add a further question to this .
presid of the commiss . - the answer is simpl : yes .
i know she will do a fantast job .
we all know that this in an innov .
we are at a preparatori work stage .
i would like to say someth which is veri serious .
that is veri much follow-up to the european council ' .
in fact , it is becom an extrem difficult matter .
so it is a veri broad remit of compet .
regard the delay , you are right : there is some delay .
i hope to have it by the end of januari .
onli today .
the timet that you are give u is extrem tight .
i share your concern on this issu .
you will therefor have more time .
i am also hope for a commit from you on this point .
i myself am readi to make a commit .
that is whi i wa keen to present it now .
how would you defend this decis ?
rather , they should be the subject of an amend budget .
mr porta , thank you for your question .
you spoke of the design of certain commission .
we have to respect the rule of law in the european union .
so i believ they have the qualiti to fulfil their respons .
so far , that posit ha not exist .
that commission will have a lot of respons .
that is a compet of the commiss .
my answer is the follow .
we have to look at this .
we have to look at own resourc of the european union .
we have promis it to parliament .
it wa not an invent of the commiss .
my first question is a follow .
is it prepar to be more flexibl ?
this mean that price rise and develop becom imposs .
issu relat to immigr have a secur aspect .
anoth aspect is combat illeg immigr and traffick network .
frontex take care of this .
symbol and tear are no longer enough .
thank you , mr presid of the commiss .
we achiev much more than last time , one month ago .
thank you veri much , too , for keep perfect to your time .
we will see you again for question hour next month .
( applaus )
from the citizen ' perspect , combat crime is import .
we need common solut to common problem .
it take time and incur cost for the individu .
there are no simpl solut .
there are a number of propos for legisl act on the tabl .
we need , first and foremost , to make progress on these .
thank you veri much for your attent .
you emphasis respect for fundament right .
you emphasis child protect .
the union must remain at the forefront on this issu .
we are now go to be abl to put all of this into practic .
this hing on train .
we share your view on this point too .
thank you , parliament .
they are make demand of u .
they want answer from u .
the first point is work with the council .
my second point is that we must be creator of idea .
the new treati give u the opportun to tabl legisl initi .
in futur , we will have the opportun to do that .
i would like to share the follow stori with you .
she call the stewardess over to complain about her seat .
howev , we do have one seat in first class . '
now , what ha this got to do with u ?
do we consid other inferior ?
the white south african ladi would shock u all .
but that wa obvious an extrem exampl .
i will turn now to the content of the stockholm programm .
we , parliament , veri much need to do someth about that .
we green can not vote yes ' to the resolut a it stand .
the exchang of inform help combat terror .
this is where stockholm fail .
we need to move from word to deed .
europ seem not to want to move in the same direct .
offici , the aim here is to combat organis crime .
secur is a citizen 's right , a is freedom .
it is high time parliament recognis this for onc .
one exampl is the immigr polici .
he now languish in a greek prison await trial .
the identif evid is contradictori .
in the process , it will destroy peopl 's live .
this is definit the right thing to do .
how are we go to get there ?
the member state and europ must guarante secur .
think of guantánamo .
europ is the fatherland of right .
that is the citizen 's europ .
mobil is now a right .
the council should take it into proper account .
this is not the case at present and there are sever weak .
it is shock that this ha to go to strasbourg .
howev , it is also an extrem complex issu .
it is anoth step in the build of the eu state .
it is noth other than the pool of sovereignti .
parliament give ad valu to the commiss propos .
thank you , zita .
the union must respect this nation compet .
they are the futur .
what are we do to protect them ?
let u final show some sen of pragmat in our institut !
that is what our fellow citizen expect from u .
but we must have a stockholm blueprint in the first place .
we want a horizont direct .
we must fight for this progress line .
it is now time for the catch-the-ey ' period .
i am go to adher absolut strict to the rule of procedur .
of cours , the stockholm programm will be what we make it .
let u give it a chanc .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
when we are not free , we are not secur .
we find that balanc a bit mislead .
what do you mean by that ?
i would prefer to see a strengthen there .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
( the presid cut off the speaker )
mr presid , thank you for all of your point of view .
someon said that this programm is ambiti .
allow me to comment on two area .
the first one is the question of form .
that is whi we have veri mani discus .
we will , of cours , give these care consider .
that is precis the aim of the stockholm programm .
i believ that this is import .
mani peopl mention subsidiar .
i think that this type of argument is complet irrelev .
i can say to you that it will get wors yet .
instead , all of the point contain a solidar element .
the role of frontex should be strengthen .
mr keller mention this in her speech .
it is a problem that requir sever differ type of measur .
we must retain the benefit of this .
i would like to say that this text seem fair balanc to me .
this is where europ can bring ad valu .
you gave the exampl of a british citizen in greec .
mr billström ha cover this .
there is no deni that this is the case .
the debat is close .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 .
written statement ( rule 149 )
this legal act must come into forc a soon a possibl .
this will be the task of spain 's forthcom eu presid .
howev , a ban doe not go far enough .
i am go to run through the principl .
this return direct is not yet in forc .
so what can we do ?
this question ha been ask within each of our member state .
they are oblig to do so .
with this in mind , i would ask for clarif on three point .
this turn our idea of human right on it head .
commission , this is not the europ that we love .
it is too easi to put the blame on europ .
i am veri grate for ani explan you can give u .
question have alreadi been ask .
is afghanistan a safe countri ?
second , there is ambigu surround collect expuls .
articl 19 ( 1 ) : collect expuls are prohibit ' .
you tell u that this is not a collect expuls .
there are limit !
and what are those limit ?
i , howev , am appal by the waffl that we have been fed .
let u stop play with word .
yes , collect expuls were inde organis .
the european union take great pride in defend human right .
the right of asylum is one of those fundament right .
mr presid , i found part of the discus a bit strang .
whi are the peopl here illeg ?
it is mere a question of logist in this context .
mr presid , my thank to all of the speaker .
it is veri , veri difficult .
what i want to do first is respond .
i shall read the follow , from the french respons .
we also receiv a respons from the uk govern .
i believ that this must inde be said .
i wish to thank the swedish presid .

all of the countri need to start do this .
that is what i wish to say .
that conclud the item .
2007 discharg : eu general budget - council ( debat )
rapporteur : søren bo søndergaard
thank you , mr presid .
in realiti , this wa noth new .
it had , in fact , been go on for mani year .
if so , they will have been disappoint .
at the end of septemb , someth final happen .
the ball is now in the council 's court .
open and transpar are the democrat tool we have avail .
today we are talk about discharg for 2007 .
this will be the case in futur , too .
mr presid , mr malmström , mr barrot , a miracl ha occur .
( applaus )
all 's well that end well , a we say in germani ?
no , not this time .
i would like to thank the swedish presid onc again .
we have made interest begin .
we do not like how the debat ha been go so far .
we do not have signific reserv here .
this repres a breakthrough .
yet we must admit that this remain a difficult exercis .
therefor , we must strive toward a breakthrough .
we have broken the deadlock provision .
after all , the problem have not been solv .
four reason were cite for this .
yet where are the precis answer to these question ?
can you tell me that ?
no , you can not .
i therefor ask the hous to support the motion .
there is still a veri long way to go .
we must chang this state of affair .
progress ha been made in these area .
this is the right step in the right direct .
( applaus )
mr presid , thank you for debat this extrem import matter .
i am plea that we agre on the import of open and transpar .
thank you veri much for this debat .
that wa the posit we start from .
i agre that we have not achiev everyth we want to .
we have come a step closer , howev .
we will be start from the point we have reach this year .
the debat is close .
the vote will take place on wednesday , 25 novemb 2009 .
written statement ( rule 149 )
that would be complet absurd .
question time ( commiss )
the next item is question time ( b7-0223/2009 ) .
the follow question are address to the commiss .
2009 is the european year of creativ and innov .
this is be done in collabor with the european invest fund .
i have anoth comment to make on innov .
we have good , and in some case outstand , research capac .
do you believ that the said programm can be extend ?
will it categoris such measur a anti-competit ?
there is no discrimin at all .
subject : inform on energi price for consum
this wa the main object of liberalis .
bill accuraci is close relat to meter frequenc .
meter-read frequenc is not defin by eu legisl .
howev , this is indirect address by smart meter .
self-regul is not suffici .
plea take this back to the commiss and think again .
subject : food label for consum
this is exact the reason whi we put forward this regul .
i must say we were amaz by the number of applic receiv .
we were expect a few hundr and we receiv 44 000 claim .
what will happen then ?
it is about the origin of the product .
we are talk now about health claim .
subject : vari consum right
i could of cours provid you with the websit .
i also have some news which is veri import for u .
we have two new extens to the dolceta inform websit .
i thank the commission for her respons .
we have a network of such author .
otherwis , it is veri much divid from countri to countri .
the consum portfolio is realli veri import .
i think that one of these miss link is the retail market .
i shall , howev , certain pas on the messag .
subject : car rental compani
i person receiv mani of them .
there must be some direct which the compani are breach .
i think this is a major problem .
the tank wa full and wa paid for by the compani .
i had to return it full again .
that is straightforward best practic .
it is fair , it is transpar and it is proper .
the result were rough what we had expect .
i will mention a topic exampl in this regard .
despit this , the commiss still stand by it propos .
subject : tourism under lisbon
we do have immens structur chang to deal with , howev .
thank you for that remark , mr posselt .
the next item is a joint debat on
i hope that you can confirm this again today .
a total of eur 14.8 million is envisag for this .
what conclus can be reach ?
the first budgetari point you rais relat to fund sourc .
that is the principl issu .
the commiss must notifi the other member state .
the factori in ireland focus on produc desktop comput .
this will be veri welcom .
i must , howev , stress that we are onli halfway there .
howev , the various kind of state aid involv chang thing .
we therefor support this report .
there are two caveat i would add .
have said that , there are just two point i want to make .
peopl are veri grate for what ha happen .
you have given hope where there wa despair .
thank you veri much inde .
first , i am glad that it exist .
that is the social side of europ , and it is a good side .
the answer is no ' !
what you gave u today , commission , wa an evas answer .
you are hide behind the polish govern 's report .
that is what the globalis fund allow u to do .
he said that we can not influenc busi decis .
that is simpli not true .
we simpli feel that better use can be made of it .
this is precis the problem that we are face today .
the issu of individu budget item wa also rais .
nonetheless , the fund can oper in this way .
the second issu is that of the dell case itself .
that is not in the interest of the origin .
the debat is close .
the vote will take place on wednesday , 25 novemb 2009 .
written statement ( rule 149 )
the state of play of the eurom free trade area ( debat )
can the commiss back up it respons with sound reason ?
those are my question , mr presid , commission .
the eurom free trade area also ha a south-south dimens .
the deal wa seal in decemb 2008 .
i believ in it even le sinc the fact speak for themselv .
howev , the negoti still need to be steer in this direct .
it is unaccept to go on think that way .
the first factor is time .
therefor , we do not have much time .
but it is not just light bulb .
there is also the matter of human right .
in this instanc , i have to ask what is go on here .
if that is our aim , then we are on the right track .
tonight we are discus a free trade agreement in the eurom .
i , too , have a question for the commission .
if so , how long will it take ?
i heard mr tajani answer : libya and syria .
i will attempt to answer your question , where possibl .
the debat is close .
the vote will take place on wednesday , 25 novemb 2009 .
henc this oral question .
and what about interoper in the rail sector ?
if this is so , then action is need urgent .
i will now start to conclud .
all the new applic take the compat standard a their basi .
are there adequ control ?
everi railroad ha it own technic standard .
if they are electr railroad , it is either dc or ac .
if it is ac , it is either 15 kv , or 30 kv , or 35 kv .
all of the other have differ between them .
therefor , mr presid , let u give the railroad a chanc .
mr presid , ladi and gentleman , safeti is a sacr thing .
it must be given absolut prioriti .
this state of affair can not go on .
the money is avail .
that is not enough , howev .
there is alway a need for more profit .
( de ) mr presid , it is not actual astonish .
we have gone down the wrong road here .
that road is certain not further liberalis .
it is the opposit rout .
in my view , there are huge delay on this aspect .
lack of this invest will increas the number of rail accid .
the interoper of railway system is vital .
i am therefor in full agreement .
the debat is close .
written statement ( rule 149 )
i thank him for make this point .
let me give you a few exampl .
such a law can not , obvious , be implement proper .
mr presid , just a final word .
mr bauer , you were critic of the languag law .
it doe not infring fundament right , howev .
that too must be state .
that must be our concern .
we must therefor bring these element togeth .
togeth , we have a rang of problem .
in the end , we are all member of minor .
those were two good reason .
ethnic minor repres were not involv in draft the amend .
the hungarian govern close them down in 1961 .
can a nation minor be regard a someth of valu ?
doe it matter ?
is a minor of valu then ?
is a minor languag of valu ?
this law simpli can not be implement proper .
europ should be asham a long a this law exist .
this should not be a disput between slovakia and hungari .
what is this agenda item deal with ?
it is certain reluct to resolv this issu .
it is not two countri fight against each other .
hungarian member here are attack the slovak languag law .
we must reject this , ladi and gentleman .
this is total unaccept .
that is an abus and misus of languag .
we can not have doubl standard .
in wale , the key ha been to take a pragmat approach .
howev , diver should be celebr .
( the speaker spoke in welsh )

these issu will have top prioriti at the final summit .
it is a decis i welcom and person support veri much .
i will now move on to the portfolio alloc .
first , climat chang .
what should the key messag from the european council be ?
sometim we see politician and diplomat negoti .
we can not negoti against the scienc of natur .
the agreement should be precis .
in particular , fast start fund is go to be veri import .
i will attend myself .
we have come a long way over the last 10 year .
now the lisbon treati give u a new opportun to move ahead .
now we must keep the strength of purpos and sen of focus .
let u make the most out of what lie ahead .
let u work togeth for the common european good .
mr presid , ladi and gentleman , here we are at last .
inde , i expect the council to evolv .
the second topic is climat chang .
this is essenti .
it is import for u to discus peopl and posit .
we have achiev what we have been fight for .
nevertheless , this is not enough .
in my opinion , we are not talk enough about climat chang .
can europ 's energi secur problem be solv peac ?
this is a job for the high repres of the european union .
that is much more import .
( applaus )
we social democrat have discus our idea with you .
first of all , copenhagen .
we have to make a success of it .
the second point is the stockholm programm .
that is my fear for the moment .
we are go in the opposit direct .
we do not want mere token gestur .
everyon is say that the belgian are veri proud of him .
that wa my look back at last week .
the next summit will soon be upon u .
we are draw too few logic conclus from our discus .
whi did we get into such a disastr econom crisi ?
final , i would like to look at the stockholm programm .
it wa a serious mistak not to put swift on the agenda .
but this miss a vital point .
david cameron should be asham of himself .
it is go , go , go all the time .
they are pro the eu .
i think that is an honour posit for u to take .
abov all , we welcom the fact that a woman ha been elect .
we also need to discus this subject .
i have just three observ to make about this .
we are interest to see how you will achiev this .
voluntari commit have never achiev the desir object .
i thought this wa go to be a big , proud moment !
no wonder , sir , you look so happi this morn .
and we have a new presid of europ , herman van rompuy .
it doe not exact trip off the tongu , doe it ?
in some way she is ideal , is she not ?
so i guess she is perfect for this european union .
( the presid ask the speaker to conclud )
i mean , no one ha ever heard of her .
she is even le well-known than herman van rompuy !
i mean , that take some do , doe it not ?
she ha risen without trace .
she is part of this post-democrat age .
her appoint is an embarrass for britain .
( interject from the floor )
well , at least i have been elect , sir , unlik her !
but just hear the next bit .
there is someth rather more serious than that .
that question must be ask .
if we realli think that , frank , we need our bump felt !
she ha no experi and she must answer those question .
did she take money from enemi of the west ?
that question must be answer .
well , we have our two pygmi .
the european state is here .
i would like to say a word to mr farag .
i think this is the stake .
we have to stand up for them .
we have to save their person integr .
they have not been elect .
it is all about bureaucraci versus democraci .
thing have gone horribl , horribl wrong .
could you plea explain what that wa ?
i want to know .
( protest )
that is my opinion , colleagu .
in addit , repay rule must be introduc .
i think that is veri good .
they will have an overarch view and enhanc cooper .
thank you veri much .
i will , of cours , speak again at the end of this debat .
it also ha to do with the stockholm programm .
we are not talk about theoret case .
we are talk about actual case .
i can give you some data on that , if you wish .
i can give you concret exampl .
they subsequ confess to these activ .
we are talk about an extrem serious matter .
and we stand by it .
i would like to buck the trend .
this mean we will have to work much harder .
life is not go to be easier for u .
on the contrari , it is go to becom more complic .
this is a major achiev .
the first point is the council presid .
i think that this is a veri good idea .
it is right that you should work togeth with the council .
one final word on the debat cultur in this hous .
we onli need to listen to mr farag .
but mani of u feel that we have miss a critic opportun .
this is where ani intern agreement made will be deliv .
how is the eu respond to this ?
will this be on the council agenda ?
i veri much doubt it , but it should be .
i do not know of ani mep with that much secur .
do these personnel decis convey an import messag to u ?
they do , inde .
howev , this involv a decis step against the unit state .
today , howev , thing have chang .
what is import is how the treati will be appli .
let me explain what i mean .
i prefer to recal with you the right and duti of we mep .
have said that , i shall now take up a number of point .
first , the issu of appoint .
we owe it to them .
i believ that is a mistak .
final , i would like to say one thing .
it time will be up .
( lv ) thank you , mr presid .
last week , european societi experienc two event .
i think that this will be a task for the futur .
europ 's citizen must be at the heart of this strategi .
thank you and i wish you everi success at the meet .
we need to act , but fight this alon will not work .
that is what i want to talk about a well : the how ' .
this process wa untranspar .
transpar must rule in the futur .
the what ' must be the focus on our citizen .
this is in our common interest .
this fact speak for itself .
what ha not been done to save the treati of lisbon ?
it is rare to come across someon embodi so mani qualiti .
i am not the onli one to deplor this state of affair .
i would like to make two brief reflect .
these are the challeng that our elector want u to tackl .
the second reflect concern parliament 's role .
whi should they be famous ?
howev , it is not just god 's gift .
there are no longer ani formal excus to abstain from them .
the second problem aris from the econom crisi .
this year ha been a veri success one for the fyrom .
in 2009 , the fyrom made signific progress .
second , implement of the treati of lisbon is begin .
this , too , is a matter for the forthcom council .
in addit , there is everyth connect with the econom crisi .
thank you .
i think that this critic is unfair .
if it were true , it would be quit absurd .
these are veri import attribut in the time we live in .
what do we want ?
a destroy , a disrupt ?
i wish him well .
those day are over .
first , we need to be cautious about the end of the crisi .
it is also time to plot the rout ahead .
time chang .
one concern the sale of carbon dioxid quota after 2012 .

we are here a the peopl 's tribun .
that be said , the role of this adjust fund must be ass .
the fund is not reflect the reason for which it wa set up .
we know where that road lead .
let u not go there a second time .
they have also been vote on here today .
the first is that we need to reach a legal bind agreement .
we need to have ambiti target in this regard .
mr presid , i support this resolut .
howev , the rich countri have to play the lead role .
there ha alway been global warm .
thank you for have taken notic of what i have said .
a a conserv , i consid myself a natur conservationist .

thank you .
written explan of vote
the aim is to promot the use of safe , quieter tyre .
this label is benefici from an environment point of view .
i therefor vote in favour .
this is whi this regul will help reduc these emiss .
the crucial role of this fund is clear .
this state aid wa approv by the european commiss .
yes , i am behind dell 's employe !
at ani rate , this is not our vision of europ .
futur cooper with nation parliament is also import here .
there are mere a few new procedur .
for this reason , i have vote no .
for those reason , i vote in favour of this report .
the world is stake it futur on the month to come .
we can not justifi this to taxpay .
ireland 's per caput carbon emiss is 17.5 tonn per annum .
i believ that the copenhagen agreement should be bind .
i can not justifi to my voter use their money in this way .
that is not the societi we want .
the current situat confirm that these predict were right .
howev , just make a law is not enough .
we have achiev a good result .
in addit , the treati of lisbon give u secur .
the popul need increas level of secur .
i think we have chosen a good middl way .
the mediterranean is the cradl of civilis a we know it .
i am against implement such a free trade area .
( explan of vote abbrevi in accord with rule 170 )
i therefor vote in favour .
that is whi we abstain .
that is a shame and that is whi i will abstain .
no addit cost must be involv for small and medium-s busi .

the effort of mani peopl combin to produc this success .
we would like to offer our congratul .
i congratul you all .
approv of the minut of the previous sit : see minut
this is , if anyth , an understat .
we all know that the process ha not been entir easi .
our magnet is still there .
this will be neither fast nor easi .
that is whi articl 49 remain of such fundament import .
that is a major and most import step forward .
this is import for croatia and for the entir region .
the import of this can hard be exagger .
this will start a new era in the eu 's foreign polici .
icti cooper remain a must .
we have seen steadi progress in turkey a well .
the countri suffici fulfil the copenhagen polit criterion .
there ha been good news in serbia too .
i agre with your draft resolut to unblock the agreement .
he merit our full recognit .
that is a great piti , in my opinion .
we do not approv of that .
let me conclud .
i wish you everi success for the futur .
that is especi true for south-eastern europ .
one last thing : other ethnic minor and sexual minor .
i find this is an import path toward democratis .
i also welcom the fact that iceland may be a candid soon .
i should like to mention the case of turkey .
i should also like to mention the case of kosovo .
what an outrag and baseless comparison !
we should not be deni the possibl of criticis islam .
but turkey is show it true colour here .
let u be honest with the turk .
ceas all negoti with turkey and other islam countri .
i would like to make a few comment .
i hope that will be review in plenari .
we think too much about this past .
third , each countri should inde come in base on it merit .
here , i would singl out turkey , in particular .
this is becaus it increas integr and secur .
let u also not shut the door on our eastern partner .
we should offer ukrain a clear possibl of membership .
there is one more thing .
this is a contradict of the principl of solidar .
we must stop obscur and minimis the problem .
we all need to be brave enough to face the realiti .
veri recent , 45 % of turk support this object .
there are , of cours , outstand question .
so let u all work on them .
this is a question which we have not definit answer .
we need institut reform .
this is not right .
let this be our enlarg strategi for 2010 .
this ha alreadi been discus today in plenari .
whi did we have to pay compliment to turkey ?
this is obvious all about u interest .
i will not even tri .
it deserv recognit for this success .
it wa reject by the south .
the eu ha a moral duti here .
that is what it is about .
this situat is unstabl , unten and unsustain .
i mean consolid , condit and communic .
i am about to conclud .
i would like to repeat that here .
we are now expect a last solut .
that is not the problem .
this doe not seem to me to be an ideal neighbourhood .
i agre , but we must consid that turk are turk .
it is not a path pave with rose .
in other word , full adapt is requir for full integr .
we must not tri and hide behind our finger .
the preced of slovenia and croatia confirm this .
the reason is simpl .
a lot of the work is alreadi done .
i would also like u to view it a an histor process .
on the one hand , a new process doe not mean go for broke .
final , allow me to say a word about turkey .
i wa recent in banja luka and sarajevo .
how can we make contact with broad swath of the popul ?
that is what europ is about .
i am of exact the same opinion .
bulli a neighbour countri is never help .
it ha done noth .
the aim of access progress is the access itself .
the process , it should be stress , is voluntari .
without implement , the process remain empti .
much ha been achiev .
i think that is a sourc of strength .
i did listen to the debat .
you are not part of one of the major group .
i am sorri about that .
we fought a veri bitter referendum campaign .
we won that narrowli .
it took polit leadership to achiev that .
it doe not happen by itself .
it requir reform .
it requir reconcili .
and that appli to each and everi one .
it did appli to sweden onc upon a time , and we manag .
it appli to each and everi one .
( applaus from the centr left )
so that is what we have to abid by .
i think that would be a mistak .
( applaus from the centr left )
could i just final pick up one of my favourit item .
i do not like the word .
i do not see our union a absorb ' nation .
i do not know if we have absorb britain .
and i do not know if franc want to be absorb .
and i hope sweden will never be absorb .
articl 49 appli .
that is true .
be that a it may , it ha been great to work with you .
togeth we have made a differ .
( applaus )
the debat is close .
the vote will take place on thursday , 26 novemb 2009 .
written statement ( rule 149 )
i unreserv support this close interest .
in write . - i would like to make three observ .
it is high time that we began speak honest and clear .
serbia ha made particular signific progress recent .
the serbian parliament ha adopt a law on nation council .
this appli to all state , includ turkey .
elimin of violenc against woman ( debat )
the next item is the debat on :
now i feel that we actual need to see some concret action .
it affect and defin woman 's everyday live .
that is not the case .
it is structur violenc and a social issu .
societi must take respons for stop this violenc .
at the same time , it help to maintain this power order .
this is a public health problem .
howev , it is , abov all , an equal problem .
it should be time for this now !
i would like to start with someth posit .
howev , measur are also taken at european level .
howev , we should not be content with this .
employ is often the best way to leav poverti behind .
econom and social crise make woman more vulner .
i am grate to parliament for rais this issu today .
the result of this studi will be present in autumn 2010 .
this is whi i would like to add a few word on this point .
madam presid , i would like to finish on a person note .
it is therefor a topic that must be tackl on differ front .
we can not simpli remain passiv spectat .
it is essenti that we in the eu take action now .
i hope this will be prioriti for all of u .
it is not onli an equal issu .
they are from all socio-econom group .
there is no such thing a a stereotyp .
violenc affect the victim , their famili and child .
it effect are both insular and outgo and destroy live .
the road to rebuild these live is long and need support .
project like this need support , and need financi support .
let me stress again : this is total unaccept .
some woman are murder simpli becaus they are woman .
it should therefor serv a an exampl to the rest of europ .
we must make a joint effort and work togeth .
this is an essenti condit for real equal and end violenc .
the figur are alarm .
talk about it is not enough .
it is time for action .
to punish her , her husband pour acid over her .
he did it one night ; he did it while she wa sleep .
that is whi i am take part in the white ribbon campaign .
appar that is not enough .
this is not just a problem for woman .
it is a problem for everyon in the world .
budget link to these polici have explod .
yet violenc against woman is not in declin .
it is link to discrimin base on gender .
how do we combat sexism ?
it wa horribl , simpli horribl .
but it is also the truth .
unfortun , i do not think there is a legal basi for that .
the debat is close .
written statement ( rule 149 )
similar , statist in other member state are mislead .
the motion right focus on the prosecut of perpetr .
for victim , creat shelter is not enough .
no social problem can be solv complet in just six month .
piraci is a veri serious threat inde .
this ha prove help .
coordin is , of cours , the key to success .
there are current 75 suspect be held in kenyan jail .
much remain to be done .
on the secur side , a rapid approach is essenti .
but , we all know that much more ha yet to be done .
let me now turn to anoth import issu befor conclud .
we want the mandat to continu unchang .
that is inde the natur of the problem and it veri root .
no , that is certain not the solut .
commission , what you said wa a pleasant surpris to me .
in this hous , we are go to talk of europ and more europ .
oper atalanta is inadequ , howev .
the communiti 's institut are duti bound to do so .
we think this is essenti .
what is the real goal of this mission ?
what is the overal polit concept for somalia ?
what legitimaci doe the transit govern have ?
whi are we support it ?
whi do we believ that the soldier will help it ?
( e ) mr de grand pascual , plea do not tri to bandi word .
we condemn ani act of piraci , without a doubt .
over time , we need to tri and deal with it all .
but let u also be realist .
result have been fair limit .
we are tri to do certain thing .
that is not the reason for not do what we can do .
that is what we are tri to do with differ train programm .
is there a guarante of this be success ?
no , there is not .
that in itself is someth to be proud of .
so it is inde a veri complex process .
if they have an interest , then they might inde do so .
the debat is close .
written statement ( rule 149 )
they must therefor be classifi a categori 3 .
at these time , they are therefor at risk of pirat attack .
therefor , act on a long-term basi , we must concentr on :
• strengthen the amisom mission ,
• strive for last peac agreement between the parti , and ,
smoke-fre environ ( debat )
they have all been outstand .
there is no safe level of exposur to passiv tobacco smoke .
articl 8 concern protect against exposur to tobacco smoke .
the council share this view .
this resolut contain numer new element .
the inform obtain may provid a massiv servic .
to legisl doe not mean to oppress .
it is a complet absurd situat .
passiv smoke is a huge problem , particular for child .
we can onli protect worker .
howev , it is this sort of protect that is urgent need .
we need this chang and we should support it .
they were furious about the ban .
peopl have come to live with it .
but let u not demonis smoker .
of cours , there is still more to achiev .
i agre with the point that she made .
peopl resist it but now they accept it .
there is a complet chang .
they will not regret it , i can guarante that .
i am a federalist but i am not a centralist .
what ha happen to the cross-bord implic ?
we need comprehens protect in this area .
i believ that we have mani point of view in common .
the debat is close .
written statement ( rule 149 )
in write . - ( de ) i am a non-smok myself .
( the sit wa suspend at 19.30 and resum at 21.00 )
composit of committe and deleg : see minut
the ratif and implement of the updat ilo convent ( debat )
our valu are those on which the ilo wa found .
it now seem that you must take much more ambiti action .
this is where the question aris .
sure we can manag that in the eu .
for two reason .
we should practis what we preach .
we will therefor also support this .
onli individu member state can do this .
howev , other area need to be includ .
the right to strike is also a fundament right .
we do not need more talk ; what we need is action .
the eu must take the lead .
they do not ratifi them and they do not implement them .
we hope that this will happen a soon a possibl .
there is also an extern dimens to this .
the debat is close .
the vote will take place on thursday , 26 novemb 2009 .
onc more , world food secur ha been in the spotlight .
the prioriti now is to honour them .
howev , we need more and sustain assist over time .
other countri and region should do the same .
what ha happen sinc then ?
hunger ha not been halv , it ha increas .
more than 1 billion peopl suffer from hunger everi day .
the opposit of what these organis intend ha occur .
there is a wide rang of differ caus for this .
howev , we share the respons for this .
the european socialist are readi for this challeng .
that is someth we have to take veri , veri serious .
the need to support local product is obvious .
here and elsewher we continu to make our fine speech .
until now , we work the land to feed peopl .
we must hear the cri of famin and act accord .
that would make europ grow in statur , and it is urgent !
end of quot .
yet , there is no mention of this in the final declar .
that is my person duti and our collect respons .
( bg ) i person attend the fao meet in rome .
i saw with my own eye what this confer wa like .
i will give but one exampl .
that countri wa ukrain .
i would advis caution about what is said in this chamber .
agricultur is go to be veri import in the next few year .
it happen in madagascar , for instanc .
this seem to be too sensit for world leader to discus .
whi did you not do that ?
then there is the common agricultur polici of the eu .
we produc a lot of food .
that caus food shortag and bring a need for food import .
we accept that .
so there are three point which we need to understand .
farmer in northern ireland want to help to meet that need .
cap reform will determin the farmer ' abil to produc food .
it will also influenc the price of food .
this will onli be achiev by allow farmer to farm .
i think we should all be veri plea with that .
the rest of u will talk about it .
we are not progress : we are actual move backward .
poverti is also the main reason for hunger .
two child die of hunger everi minut .
howev , hunger is not uniqu to africa .
hunger is present in the european union a well .
a child die of hunger everi six second .
sustain agricultur must be a prioriti area .
and we have got to save the live of child .
of cours , money is also need to combat world hunger .
howev , it is not just about money .
we also need to meet the follow requir beforehand .
too littl is often said about the first three point .
this mean that adequ long-term fund for the cap is requir .
first , the link between hunger and climat chang .
the cap is not perfect , but it ha been reform .
there have been similar distort in agricultur polici .
i think the crisi should teach u a lesson .
so that in itself is a veri posit element .
i think this realli is an innov .
so we should not blame ourselv all the time .
by the way , this facil wa an innov by my predecessor .
the debat is close .
the vote will take place on thursday , 26 novemb 2009 .
meat import from third countri ( debat )
let me take traceabl a an exampl .
these measur can be group into five main level of protect .
all the measur i have describ are fulli harmonis .
this bring me to my next point .
this process will continu unless adequ measur are taken .
let u , howev , examin the issu more close .
there is huge evid from the fvo in relat to this .
this situat is simpli unsustain .
how is that fair to consum in europ ?
we can not stand idl by and let this practic continu .
it is simpli unfair .
it is not just about brazilian beef .
i want to make it veri clear .
the brazilian ambassador did not lobbi me .
we will not accept second best ani more .
you are not go to destroy u ani more .
around 100 farm per month are given that right .
he said that unregul meat wa import into the eu .
you said that , mr bufton , quit earli in your present .
madam presid , i will answer that .
it is quit simpl .
the whole issu is there : it is quit clear .
that is clear the case .
we are on the same side with this one .
i will be blunt .
polit pressur brought you to your sen .
the eu commiss and the fvo have a respons to ensur both .
first , commission , you talk about poster in airport .
you have to have a sound eu food polici .
the two point i have made show it to be fall veri short .
this is a discus which is fundament to food polici .
i am not interest in shame brazil or other countri .
this is not accept .
a alreadi discus , i am not interest in partit off europ .
noth could be further from the truth .
they find themselv under attack on mani front .
how can the consum see ani logic ?
a you are well awar , europ is a net import of meat .
in our contin , europ , we produc onli 60 % of our requir .
this mean that we are forc to import .
commission , you also spoke about foot-and-mouth .
i agre with you that we have inde taken some step forward .
she could have answer more concis .
you can be sure of that .
madam presid , the debat prior to this wa about hunger .
these two debat are link .
but beef is a cash crop .
it is produc a cheapli a countri can produc it .
europ ha chosen a food model to protect it popul .
we have noth to be asham of .
this is what we are do .
we appli veri strict rule .
i gave you the figur .
that is also what we have ask brazil to do .
problem were identifi in brazil .
we have heard a lot about romania and bulgaria .
we shall remain vigil and strict .
if they do not , then they will not .

we have four key messag in this year 's annual report .
the pictur for payment , howev , continu to be mix .
cohes remain the area most affect by error .
this reduc the risk of error and the cost of control .
howev , 31 % of the budget is still colour in red .
we will definit be focus on this in the year to come .
we must deal with the problem in this area at sourc .
( applaus )
mr caldeira mention those area in his speech .
there may be fraud , there may be decept .
we must endeavour to make improv in this area .
there are certain a great mani posit thing to say today .
the level of the irregular is decreas .
these are all posit aspect .
we had seen member state such a greec fail to take part .
all the same , there are sourc of concern .
cohes will be one such issu .
a third issu to be address is the whole system of comanag .
the whole vat dossier continu to caus me concern .
i myself am rapporteur for parliament 's discharg .
this is a good thing , of cours .
this is a huge problem .
our group believ in solidar .
for the remain 48 % , they give a qualifi opinion .
but , to be honest , nobodi care about this .
it is just taxpay ' money we are deal with .
but all this is not enough .
my parti consid this sordid .
how will it make sure that those eur 4 billion are return ?
the final matter concern the conclus .
there may be veri differ kind of conclus .
they are the easiest .
whether it is effici is anoth matter .
i would like to congratul mr kalla warm in this respect .
congratul !
this is where the problem lie .
that is not correct .
we must implement a polici of name and shame .
to me , the commiss 's silenc seem high eloqu .
i agre with this .
the committe respons ha had discus along the same line .
this is not a reason way of deal with taxpay ' money .
i am not sure what this achiev .
what is the commission 's own opinion of this ?
the commiss like to present itself a the 28th donor .
could inform on the effect of polici be includ in futur ?
what condit doe the commiss actual impos , howev ?
where doe the european commiss stand on this ?
enhanc supervis and control are also need .
we welcom this .
with regard to cohes spend , there are too mani error .
i would like to reiter this propos .
this amount to eur 2.7 billion and not eur 5 billion .
the final aspect is agricultur .
the same is true in other countri a well .
we must take note of this auditor ' opinion .
we can not pretend it is the auditor ' fault .
( de ) we need a revolut in democraci !
this repres an opportun for you .
howev , now you have the opportun to look to the futur .
we have to further reduc the complex at european level .
thank you for the last five year of cooper .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
the shortcom are with the member state .
eur 2.7 billion is , of cours , a veri larg amount .
it is an unreason larg amount and it is total unaccept .
europ 's taxpay requir this .
( applaus )
this requir teamwork .
yet you will be confront with the bill , commission .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
the eu account allow a 2 % margin of error .
we can not allow ani uncertainti when it come to these .
the situat wa also the same in the two previous year .
we now pay out fund base on simpl technic requir .
i stress that i am talk about applic .
howev , i am quit optimist about the futur .
we must also look at the good news .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
i thank you for this report .
therefor , we do have to name the countri concern .
the commission , too , ha been too optimist .
quit simpli , i do not think this is good enough .
i call on the commiss to take it share of the respons .
you have the tool . you need to react more rapid .
this is my propos .
( de ) i am remind of two basic rule from my childhood .
that is my opinion .
it is import to name name in this respect .
mr presid , plea do not give in .
this doe not necessarili mean that money is be wast .
the first is the institut ' polici on build and properti .
this is also a polit issu .
( applaus )
madam presid , a simpl question .
do you accept that this is the case ?
i want to express this regret , madam presid .
( nl ) i have been present throughout the debat .
various explan have been given for this in the debat .
( hu ) madam presid , i complet agre with mr audi .
howev , the council is the most conspicu by it absenc .
sever mep have ask what can be done to solv these problem .
we consid our sampl to be appropri for draw our conclus .
the answer is yes .
( applaus )
first , one import thing wa underlin : transpar .
it is a long process and we must take it veri serious .
now some point for the futur .
veri mani thing are link to this process .
that is a key issu .
that is normal life .
you can not have a dialogu when the fact are not correct .
( applaus )
mr martin , do you wish to speak at the end of this debat ?
you should learn about democraci , mr gräßle .
we will stop there .
the debat is close .
written statement ( rule 149 )
in futur , we should put all our effort into two area .
we must deal with these question a quick a possibl .
doe copyright need to be adapt in the digit age ?
do we need to chang exist structur ?
are new monopoli be creat on the web ?
how should we react to this ?
the interest of consum are clear .
if so , what distinct should be made ?
what are the implic for the collect societi ?
do we still need them ?
i am interest to know what the commiss is plan .
first of all : the googl book project .
but meanwhil , import chang have occur .
all other book are outsid the scope of the settlement .
the new version of the settlement give rise to two remark .
first , be outsid the settlement is not alway an advantag .
this bring me to your second question .
europ ha to act swift .
both of these categori are veri loo defin .
it will contribut to the dissemin of knowledg and cultur .
unfortun , i have to say that most of the saint are gone .
this is a central question and a major necess .
this is the central issu today .
it is someth we should welcom and posit encourag .
europ should not allow itself to be control by googl .
legisl can be adapt to accommod them .
how much are we prepar to put on the tabl ?
public access to such resourc is of paramount import .
europeana make avail onlin near five million item .
the mean therefor exist .
the legisl process must speed up .
we must do our utmost to elimin digit illiteraci .
this is what we have to do , and it is no mean task .
( pt ) madam presid , this is veri iron , is it not ?
on a smaller scale , this is what we call piraci .
i think that their idea is an innov and good one .
what if they restrict access to certain book ?
they have a quota of 15 % for book that can be censur .
europ can not afford to miss the boat on this matter .
no , such a decis will influenc european cultur .
member state have differ solut here .
finian wa write a manuscript at the time .
columcill discov it and got up each night to copi it .
finian wa not plea and he ask for it back .
he did not get it back so he appeal to the high king .
we agre that the book need to go onlin and fast .
they will go anyway , whether we want it or not .
let u continu this discus .

the eu can not continu to ignor these fact .
this lead to the exist of invis crime statist .

europ ha no armi , nor doe it have ani busi be there .

therefor , we must be consist .
the european union ha no author in this area .
we are onli respons for health and safeti at work .
therefor , the member state must take action in this area .
this factori ha just close down .
howev , unfortun , french tobacco product ha disappear .
they are continu with tobacco import from abroad .
( pl ) mr presid , thank you for allow me to speak .
fight the tobacco produc is not the way to reduc smoke .
written explan of vote
thus , we could not support the motion .
the european year of volunt is henc an import initi .
i am in agreement with the rapporteur .
therefor , i support this propos .
the most basic definit of volunt is goodwil in action .
volunt are often unsung hero .
it is a wonder propos .
volunt also ha econom valu , and we must not forget this .
for this reason i vote in favour of the report .
the eu is a rock of stabil on this contin .
in write . - i vote for amend 4 .
instead it repres the geostrateg interest of the u .
turkey , in particular , ha taken a major step backward .
for this reason , i abstain .
the situat of this issu in portug is worri .
the eu need to step up it effort to combat this issu .
how can we explain this phenomenon ?
a legal basi can not be creat .
it either exist or not .
in write . - i welcom parliament 's commit to this caus .
the state alon must be respons for these .
for these reason , the ecr group ha chosen to abstain .
nation secur doe not end at nation border .
other state will contribut to the oper in the futur .
they must not be left in ani doubt about this .
what do we do about individu respons ?
tobacco is a drug .
this is my opinion on item 9 of this resolut .
these two chang have improv the final resolut .
i abstain in the vote on the resolut on smoke .
the current ban are more than suffici .
it is necessari , in particular , to protect child .
now , two year later , peopl are onli grate .
the union first need to take the mote out of it own eye .
thank you , mr presid .
this is a proactiv and ambiti resolut we are deal with .

that is just not on !
this bring discredit upon the european parliament .
there wa a debat about this at least in germani .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
therefor , let u concentr on far more import matter .
a a member of the fdp , i explicit reject this claim .
this is total the wrong approach .
the item is herebi close .
the vote will take place at the end of the debat .
lao and vietnam
we are , in fact , fair concern .
she is diabet and in a poor state of health .
i love vietnam .

this sort of abus must not be toler .
the situat in lao is not much better .

china is a gigant sweatshop of exploit of worker .

we should stand with worker in china .
mani chine peopl 's qualiti of life ha improv .
howev , sad , china is the world leader in execut .

the estim number of unreport case is much higher .

the principl of this resolut are one i share .
that is imposs .
furthermor , china is not a democraci .
human right are not respect .
china ha a harsh polici against taiwan .
china should be put under pressur .
therefor , we support this resolut .
china is a power player on the world stage .
( applaus )
the citi still retain this spirit of freedom today .
unfortun , that ha not been the case .
we would like the death penalti to be abolish everywher .
this should all be found in this resolut .
that is what i wish for everyon .
our polici toward china is one of construct engag .
tibet 's situat ha invari been approach a such .

one-minut speech on matter of polit import
these are the worri i want to share with you .
what ha happen in hondura is extrem regrett !
he is absolut right too .
i would like to talk in simpl term here .
we can not remain silent .
this can go on no longer .
my request ha been sign by 75 member and five polit group .
i hope that my request is grant .
this is unaccept .
this appli particular to the western balkan region .
it is up to them to make use of it .
that will be a great day and an opportun for celebr .
this also goe for the popul of kosovo .
the western balkan need a clear european perspect .
let u not give in to unfound fear .
that last statement , howev , is high question .
the number of arm attack also rose by 200 % overal .
the financi effici of this oper is also high question .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
i think that this absurd is unaccept in europ .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
at this moment , the main link is the via baltica ...
( the presid cut off the speaker )
at the moment , these tendenc are frequent and widespread .
we must pay attent to those who have not spoken at all .
i am sorri but those are just the rule .
i am veri sorri that not everybodi could take the floor .
i do not think we should speak in such a way .
first of all , cereal .
in the pigmeat sector , the situat is still fragil .
a far a we can see , consumpt will recov .
to summaris , i see some timid sign of recoveri .
i am sure we will come back to these import issu a well .
our farmer hard dare believ this anymor .
howev , we are still play catch-up .
there is much that we agre with here .
that is someth that we have also advoc for a long time .
the price are fall for farmer , but not for consum .
farmer must not mere be produc of raw materi .
we must now focus on other area .
this is a veri worri trend .
can we do more for them ?
can we keep them there ?
inde , small- and medium-s farm can no longer cope .
unfortun , this current onli occur on a limit basi .
livestock farm is also face a huge crisi .
we are now at the merci of extern market .
but help farmer is not just about agricultur polici .
we should be work here in a holist way .
let u make sure we take it .
this problem will resurfac again within a year or so .
the econom crisi ha hit farmer hard .
the last financi year wa one of the worst of the decad .
econom crise expo defici - defici caus by peopl .
crise onli becom disast if noth is done about them .
this mean that europ is pay to have more desert !
are you go to stop this ?
they must compli with increas complex system .
a success of new anim welfar measur is be introduc .
mr presid , i welcom this debat .
thank you , mr kelli .
the commiss must accept the import of agricultur .
face up to it bold !
there are , no doubt , mani reason for this .
this is caus ever greater problem for our farmer .
that is certain not the case .
i expect the next commiss to present such a propos .
it is alreadi possibl for farmer to do this .
but new initi can not be present by a caretak commiss .
the debat is close .
written statement ( rule 149 )
there are also difficulti in obtain credit .
these problem are serious affect their incom .
that is becaus :
it also ha to deal with :
that is the ultim deadlin .
so i expect this to go forward .
cotton ha come to symbolis this situat .
this is a step backward .
the european union must therefor adopt a clear posit .
now we need to bring the negoti to a conclus .
for this to happen , we need a signal of polit will .
the european union can and must play a lead role in this .
we must now also rais the public 's awar .
we need broader support from the citizen .
i do not see ani altern to doha .
that must not happen .
we therefor need a conclus to the doha round now .
in the meantim , howev , the negoti have fail twice .
we can not behav a if we can carri on in the same way .
we call for a new start to the process .
european integr began with free trade .
the balanc of our global econom order is disastr .
two billion peopl live in extrem poverti .
might you work toward a solut ?
this is the onli reloc that europ could welcom .
a trade deficit increas of this magnitud is unsustain .
the current trade system encourag the growth of co2 emiss .
rise european unemploy mean greater co2 emiss .
blame the crisi .
that is whi our amend make sever point .
( applaus )
( de ) mr presid , we need a revolut in democraci .
the european union ha support this flexibl approach .
the debat is close .
written statement ( rule 149 )
globalis can be a bless , and not a cur .
thank you veri much .
for this purpos , austria ha appli for eur 5.7 million .
the first budgetari point you rais relat to fund sourc .
mr presid , unusu time call for unusu measur .
i am plea to note the converg of goodwil .
howev , our role should not just be to approv this fund .
more sustain and more inclus are requir .
we must dare to make real choic .
first , this is an unjust measur .
howev , this repres a piecem approach .
this is just a wast of taxpay ' money .
how can we treat their money with such contempt ?
i will reject this resolut , and urg you to do the same .
thank you , commission .
car sale have fallen by 59.4 % .
the request are again accompani by a whole seri of ambigu .
the support in austria is not be grant to just one person .
that is veri much to be welcom .
steiermark will sure be in favour of that .
the chang are too great and too signific .
we were against the creation of such a fund .
the futur of the sector is at stake .
the econom crisi ha had a drastic impact on global trade .
this is whi i believ that the procedur must be simpl .
first , i think the start date need to be look at .
if they are help , they will deliv .
the debat is close .
the vote will take place on wednesday .
i therefor think that this clarif is an import one .
this support wa wide-rang in mani respect .
parliament wa extrem will to compromis dure the debat .
of cours , the most difficult question is the budget .
that is the current situat .
they are also be affect by the crisi .
they employ a huge number of peopl .
madam presid , i am rather surpris .
the european parliament is go to assum it respons .
the negoti were held in appropri condit .
the issu of fund is more serious .
obvious , mani financ minist did not support real negoti .
howev , they do not use it for micro-credit .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
our first critic relat to the question of total appropri .
unemploy can not be last combat in this way .
in this form , we will reject this programm .
madam presid , i veri much welcom this initi .
i sincer hope they will do so quick .
we can not agre with this propos .
the financi and econom crisi is also a social crisi .
the refer to specif group should therefor be delet .
today the econom crisi is grow into a social crisi .
such an approach is not respons , and it is unaccept .
econom growth take place when new job are creat .
privat capit ha also dri up .
howev , that is not enough .
i would therefor like to mention it here .
i think we can neutralis this risk with this financ .
sometim , peopl do not need that amount .
that is two third !
should the instrument be financ from progress - yes or no ?
eur 100 million is not go to turn that situat around .
it wa refus .
this is not about a beg hand .
this mechan must be put in place quick , in januari 2010 .
essenti help is reach financi institut .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
the path to self-employ often goe in stage .
woman want to grow with their busi .
i welcom the idea present in the commiss propos .
the european parliament committe disagre about the financ .
the member state have the prime respons .
my conclus are a follow .
we need new money for new idea .
100 million is the veri begin .
it is the issu of financ that remain open .
it wa onli abl to use money which wa avail .
howev , it is also veri import to make use of time .
thank you for the support remark and comment .
we are unabl to find ani other kind of resourc .
i think that this is unaccept .
the debat is close .
the vote will take place tomorrow .
written statement ( rule 149 )
i think that more attent need to be focus on young peopl .
toy safeti ( debat )
neither institut ha approach the commiss direct .
the first is a question that is veri easi to answer .
thus , i think the answer to this question is fair clear .
the second question is simpl , too .
this propos wa put forward by germani .
i am talk about china .
this is an extrem difficult and thorni issu .
this view wa also share by the council and by parliament .
the letter concern cadmium .
the scientif committe is look into this .
these are technic issu that are extrem complex .
the last point is quit an annoy one .
thus , you need to multipli the refer valu by one hundr .
it realli is intoler that we have to deal with such thing .
child ask for toy in these letter .
i have listen to him heap blame on scientist .
so we need to bear that in mind .
these relat direct to the christma market .
that is the commiss 's respons .
that wa the background to this .
i believ that is urgent need .
these substanc can be avoid .
the studi show that this is technic possibl .
seventi percent of toy sold are below these threshold .
it is extrem import for u to act quick .
we ought to be abl to do better than this .
anoth million will be recal from the canadian market .
it is a question of the protect of our child .
howev , i think that thing need to move more quick .
it must be done quicker than that .
it is a question of the protect of our child .
i want to make that point here , too .
allow me to make a preliminari comment .
you can judg that for yourselv .
you can not do that .
i can not do that and neither can you .
i can not assum this respons .
not one of you can do that either .
these are veri complic scientif issu .
test are need .
i am sorri , but that is not possibl .
i hope that make it clear .
the requir that you deriv from this are therefor also met .
it will surpris you when i say that i did exact that .
i would be happi to provid you with the text .
that is someth we can take pride in .
in this regard , too , we have made appropri prepar .
the last question from mr hedh is a veri import one .
it take time .
there is one last point i would like to address .
we need not hide from the american in this regard .
the debat is close .

it is not a solut , but it may help the situat .
more than eur 11 billion are be alloc for these purpos .
we want to boost the economi , main via the cohes polici .
this facil is worth eur 36 billion .
the aim is to bring about a more effici use of resourc .
the outcom ha been benefici .
the lisbon treati will bring u these instrument .
i believ that this work will produc success result .
this is exact what ha happen .
this is where we are now .
i hope that we will all work toward this .
of cours , it wa not an econom recoveri packag .
we are expect a total of eur 300 million .
we have an excit time ahead of u .
i would like to highlight four main point .
this wa inde a difficult constraint .
these negoti have produc result .
i am , howev , plea that this point , too , wa conced .
there are bare ani margin left .
i would be veri grate for your thought on this .
a other have done , i would like to highlight two thing .
are there ani programm that are not work veri well ?
now come the moment of truth .
it is now time to review thing onc again .
this is just someth for you to think about , mr šemeta .
we have now more or le resolv these problem .
we have alreadi heard about the polit symptom .
this wa a motto coin by mr surján .
we must move over to renew energi sourc .
we must reduc our co2 emiss dramat .
we must becom a low-carbon economi .
this is the onli way to creat new job .
there is one thing that i would like to add .
what is it that i want to say ?
it is too big and it keep grow .
the eu budget is an except .
it doe not reflect ani consist set of common valu .
take the exampl of the globalis adjust fund .
it wa a sign of bad plan .
we all know it would not . that is the crucial issu .
the council must know all too well how such fund are use .
doe this say someth to you ?
in the current circumst , we should renounc ani increas .
one might ask how much this will amount to .
who care ? ' come the answer , it is taxpay ' money ' .
for me , three thing are import in this area .
this budget is therefor awkward in two respect .
this budget will make eur 141 billion avail for next year .
what risk and problem can be seen ?
55 % of member state are under this averag .
where is the risk ?
altogeth , that mean that eur 4.3 billion wa plan for ...
i hope that this will be money well spent and not wast .
i welcom the fact that the milk fund ha been establish .
these are peopl who have not been help .
they are about 18 month behind in distribut of these fund .
this is a success set of prioriti .
i should like to make one observ in this connect , howev .
we should have been rather stricter .
this is objection and unaccept .
i will give you an exampl .
we have just sign a treati , but we need a new spirit .
anyway , we are now talk about the 2010 budget .
i should like to make a coupl of brief remark .
the answer is no ' .
let u not fool ourselv .
in other word , do we choos stagnat or progress ?
my answer goe without say .
we have all been turn into prima faci suspect .
that just lead to hostil and ultim to conflict .
hungari is hit particular hard by this problem .
hungarian agricultur is domin by larg hold .
the rapporteur had some harsh word for the modif .
he said that the commiss wa raid the main area .
what are the cost of the treati of lisbon ?
this ha becom a veri urgent problem .
they have becom our sacr cow .
where is the progress in the progress report ?
i would like to call for a realist approach to kozloduy .
howev , our margin are dwindl .
parliament can be proud of the 2010 budget .
thank you for your attent .
i believ that this is evid of what is happen in europ .

i think that this would be an import public servic .
everyth el becom secondari .
the increas in spend on research and innov is justifi .
this will improv our competit .
the entir fund amount to more than eur 6.6 billion .
we have to be veri clear on what we have to do next .
mr presid , i think this ha been an excit debat .
we have had differ view and that is how it should be .
some peopl want to slim down the budget .
i receiv a direct question from mr färm .

i believ that we must follow a strategi .
which one , though , ladi and gentleman ?
i therefor call for a proactiv approach .
a sen of purpos must be shown in this propos .
the reduct target is inadequ .
there are no limit to off-set ani more .
i will say one last thing to finish .
there are a lot of lead role to lose in copenhagen .
i will tri to observ the time limit .
mr reinfeldt , you do , of cours , deserv our thank .
unfortun , i am forc , here , to say some sever word .
we can not adopt unilater pro-palestinian posit .
we spoke about this yesterday dure the debat on georgia .
i think israel is the onli democraci in the middl east .
this is whi we are for peac .
i have not seen it .
what conclus can be drawn from this ?
we accus the swedish presid open .
that is what the european public want .
the netherland pay out a larg amount of money .
this situat must be rectifi a soon a possibl .
we hope that the next presid will show more courag .
plea respect u a well .

no , it is not enough .
we also spoke with mele zenawi of ethiopia and other .
so let u be honest with each other .

plea tell u the truth .
there are two reason for this .
at the same time , you are close the door ever tighter .
what happen to the social legisl ?
work on anti-discrimin ha come to a standstil .
what happen to the emiss target ?
parliament call for reduct of 32-40 percent .
final , i would like to mention vattenfal .

whi ha the swedish presid not act on this ?
with sweden , turkey is also lose an advoc for it access .
i would like to singl out two issu .
the first is the financi market crisi .
the second area is climat polici .

europ ha achiev result .
we must remain realist !
i would like to express my sincer thank for this , too .
what is the point of that ?
i can onli reject that argument .
can i say sweden ant porta ' , mr reinfeldt ?
the first thing is the implement of the lisbon treati .
a treati is never enough for solv a problem .
this wa veri import .
should we call into question the wisdom of enlarg ?

it would be a case of rob peter to pay paul .

new eu action plan for afghanistan and pakistan ( debat )
violent extrem is spread beyond the region .
a lot of attent is focus on afghanistan .
pakistan , too , face serious challeng .
an overal initi is requir .
we all need to do more and to do better .
this wa adopt in octob .
i believ that this action plan is a good tool .
the basic strategi is alreadi in place .
afghanistan is enter a decis period .
there is no need to discus the elect process further .
that is behind u .
i believ that is also the opinion of the afghan peopl .
we hope that a new govern will soon be in place .
five year with no chang is not an option .
by this i do not mean withdraw .
this militari commit must be match by civil initi .
nobodi would question this .
secur , good govern and develop must go hand in hand .
we are make a long-term commit to afghanistan .
the intern communiti is there .
we will need to do more and to do better .
that is the core of our action plan .
i would also like to say a few word about pakistan .
the 2008 elect re-establish democraci and civilian rule .
the transit to democraci ha been impress .
the eu want to help support pakistan 's civil institut .
the pakistani govern know that this must be done .
it must indic to u the area in which it wish to cooper .
we want to strengthen democraci and achiev stabil .
we are at an import point in our relat here .
we are readi to put in more resourc .
but that is all just the start .
europ ha much to offer from our own experi .
a for pakistan : yes ' to the action plan .
this is where the european union 's place and role lie .
i am put togeth all the necessari bit of inform .
the afghan gdp is just eur 6.9 billion .
we never support it and time ha prove u right .
we need someon more experienc .
in my view , it doe not .
it is a murder , pointless war that simpli can not be won .
in your statement , you refer to two key word .
you also said that our respons must be coher .
i have two comment in this respect , mr ashton .
whi is europ in afghanistan ?
it is too serious for eu postur .
time is run out !
my first question is simpl : whi did we go to afghanistan ?
today , those camp no longer exist .
in 2004 , it wa possibl to walk around kabul .
today , kabul is a huge entrench camp .
what are the consequ of all this ?
can we pull out straight away , today ?
our withdraw must therefor come with some condit attach .
third , a social level must be accept that is not perfect .
we must accept that .
this ha been done today .
i am look in your direct , baro ashton , when i say that .
is that realli the case ?
that is a mixtur of disingenu and absurd .
are we be honest in what we say ?
it would not cost much and it would be veri effici .
i essenti support what ha been said about both countri .
therefor , what structur do we actual want to set up ?
the same is envisag by the u in the secur sector .
i think not - and then we have a problem .
we can not fail .
this support is condit on transpar and clariti .
a i have said , mani import factor are at stake .
that wa in 2001 .
we are now in 2009 and exact that ha happen .
what , then , is the goal ?
these question need to be answer .
are these thing consist with each other ?
most import , we need to keep an eye on intern develop .
it alway win !
the first is an improv in secur .
it is much more complex than that .
they have the greater confid of the peopl .
this is a mission that we must carri out .
i would have like more to have been said about this .
thirti year of war is a huge problem .
i will answer some of your question .
it is absolut central .
this must continu .
it ha emerg that there is veri strong leadership in place .
we have increas the workforc by 280 intern personnel .
these are the afghan prioriti .
we must now focus on implement all these good idea .
the eu is one partner .
that is the signal we must send out .
this is go to take time .
we have to be realist .
we have an enorm amount of work ahead of u .
that is whi we need the eu to be commit .
the last one i have here is date juli 2009 .
but i do agre that we need to be more effici .
there is alway room for that .
the debat is close .
written statement ( rule 149 )
the peopl can not choos the better imperialist ' .
they actual affect u all .
belarus ( debat )
when we discus this , we focus on two import aspect .
it ha three main element .
our full support is therefor requir .
there is no other way than through dialogu .
we have to consid how effect our sanction polici is .
at the moment , discus are focus on two possibl altern .
visa facilit is link with readmiss .
the countri must continu to move forward .
the principl of the rule of law must be respect .
dialogu is essenti if our demand are to bring result .
we launch a dialogu on human right issu in june 2009 .
i realli hope this will go further .
in conclus , therefor , our offer to belarus is clear .
i think that we should also refer to that .
whi are these issu happen in belarus ?
this is the issu .
this must be avoid .
let u begin with people-to-peopl relat .
the eu must also open up to belarusian good and servic .
we must , howev , be principl in our demand .
this is not a contradict .
we should alway give attent to this .
they , too , are wait for this signal .
i know this from my own experi .
they deserv a clear and plain answer .
today , i have anoth idea .
plea say this public .
we will be much oblig to you for this .
it will be a christma present for u .
what conclus should the european institut draw from this ?
this is good .
i am afraid this will be veri difficult .
whi wa her name remov ?
it certain merit be explor to see if we can move forward .
it show that we are truli commit , we stuck out our hand .
now it is up to them to respond .
what could the eu do for belarus ?
what is on offer ?
this is what i mean by pragmat .
our messag to belarus is clear .
the debat is close .

violenc in the democrat republ of congo ( debat )
i am sure that the commiss will say more about this later .
both militari and civil esdp instrument have been use .
that is to be welcom .
these now have to be implement .
the situat is unstabl in mani way .
everi effort ha been made to prevent the worst .
this is not about call for monuc to withdraw or disengag .
first , democraci must be consolid .
parliament rais the issu of impun .
the problem is that thing can not be done in isol .
this approach must now be appli .
howev , congo doe not have to be a heart of dark .
it can be a normal countri .
i rememb the optim of 2006 .
howev , our optim ha turn out to be prematur .
let me just deal with the realiti of this .
resolut after resolut ha been pas .
i would like to make seven observ .
clear , that would be even more serious .
anoth element concern the act of violenc by the fardc .
last , i believ that we must revisit the amani programm .
that would have been a possibl a littl le than a year ago .
a alway , the question aris of whose secur is be defend .
so what is be defend in the congo ?
this chang wa suspend when the war escal onc again .
embargo have been ineffect so far .
the front are alway chang .
that is our develop challeng a a parliament .
dialogu and engag are the onli road toward such a solut .
the humanitarian crisi is deepen with everi day that pas .
this is import work for mr ashton .
a rapid respons by the european union is therefor crucial .
the phenomenon is not new .
it is extrem complex .
it is multidimension .
they are the futur of congo .
how do you intend to act more effect and more prompt ?
but , nevertheless , that is the realiti .
they did a tremend job .
we are a european union , total unit .
we did excel work in chad .
we simpli have to go in and save those peopl .
there ha been mention of militari power .
commission de gucht gave a long account of the eu 's oper .
the perpetr must not be allow to go free .
they must be brought to justic .
recruit for these mission is current under way .
of cours , this is onli a small contribut .
in such a larg countri , it is modest .
i am not go to revert back to my initi statement .
let me just focus on three thing .
this would be the worst thing one could imagin .
peopl are question whether this is compat with polit .
that is a veri interest question .
in the congo , you see one of the answer .
there is no such thing a a free lunch .
the debat is close .

i can not anticip the result of the negoti , howev .

subject : safeguard the right of disabl peopl
this is a great step , but it is onli one step .
there are no adjust for person with movement disabl .
we will work on the issu until the end of our presid .
but , unfortun , we do not have the unanim yet .
it is up to all of u to prevent discrimin of ani kind .
we wish him well in that .
i think we need to work on the overal direct first .

it is effici .
we still have work to do .
the lisbon treati present u with new possibl .
thank you veri much , and thank you to your team .
that conclud question time .
agenda for next sit : see minut
closur of the sit
open of the sit
( the sit wa open at 09.00 )
mutual recognit of profession qualif ( debat )
thank you veri much .
it is nevertheless veri good that he is here .
that is the context of the question .
let me now turn to the first question .
but there is not onli solvit .
in 2007 , it wa implement .
this is a veri serious matter .
this is a genuin problem for the citizen of europ .
this show contempt for parliament .
it is simpli outrag and we find it total unaccept .
yes , he did not get up .
well , i am sorri .
i can not accept that .
there are organis which are attempt to do this .
we must look more close at the reason behind this .
there are a number of caus .
protection is doubtless anoth of the reason .
that is anoth issu that we will have to address .
howev , i also have question for the commiss .
this could have been done much earlier .
howev , i do welcom the guidelin .
i have read them and they are certain help .
that will be the second import step .
the direct introduc harmonis of train requir for nurs .
whi is that ?
these peopl feel abandon and helpless .
howev , this is obvious not the onli problem area .
the most obvious exampl is that of the medic profess .
this is a respons for all of u .
i understand the scale of the problem perfect .
these two direct complement each other in certain respect .
that ha alreadi been mention .
mr presid , let u get straight to the point here .
nation supervis in this regard seem to be inadequ .
i should like to ask the commission three question .
it is becaus of a lack of experi and the earli morn hour .
in 2007 , we publish a transposit guid .
we believ that it is up to the member state to deliv now .
the debat is close .
written statement ( rule 149 )
this situat must chang .
at the same time , mani area are short-staf .
we need a transpar , simpl and clear recognit procedur .
the cohes polici after 2013 ( debat )
today , we are well prepar to face the futur .
but our oral question is about the futur .
those expect are confirm by public opinion poll .
subsidiar work for europ .
cohes is a notion that exclud exclus .
they are our common european public good .
we polici maker have rais the stake by promis to deliv .
develop polici with clear target and tool is need .
for me , the answer is clear .
today , this energi should come from below .
cohes polici is a good exampl of multi-level govern .
i should like to finish off with a question .
for u , there is no question that we also need to chang .
we also need to concentr on urban develop .
our approach is to creat stronger network .
life-long learn is an import concept .
cross-bord cooper is veri import to u .
it is a symbol of solidar and of overcom nation egoism .
it is an instrument for all the region .
we need reform , but it must result in genuin chang .
it must bring about sustain develop in the region .
will we manag to improv qualiti of life and make save ?
we call on the worker to reject this polici .
but wale can not afford to pay if noth is paid back out .
this doe not mean that we are close to the idea of reform .
reform yes , renationalis no !
in futur , we should also enabl job to be subsidis .
europ becom stronger whenev european solidar is shown .
this is a fundament issu for u .
renationalis this polici would be unaccept for u .
the choic is between the market and social polici .
the structur fund must be strengthen and not weaken .
i would like to say one last word about the border region .
i should like to make three brief remark in this respect .
invest relat to environ protect are also extrem import .
such a reform is simpli unimagin .
my second point is about secreci .
last but not least , i want to talk about rural develop .
suitabl resourc need to be alloc to rural develop polici .
we do not want structur fund to be renationalis .
so , mr gollnisch , you have final arriv .
i think that two main point have come out of these speech .
the most optimist estim put this time at around 2010 .
howev , these condit vari wide throughout europ .
this is whi we need a strong and adequ fund cohes polici .
we do not need renationalis .
we must not put at risk what ha alreadi been achiev .
the present intern econom crisi ha bare it teeth .
in my opinion , we go to two extrem here .
ensur equal opportun for develop is an import task .
i should just like to highlight two issu .
i am refer here , abov all , to young peopl .
this is the onli way we can face the futur with certainti .
the debat is close .
written statement ( rule 149 )
coordin with the eu 's other polici must also be improv .
the implement rule must also be great simplifi .
in this context , interregion cooper play an import role .
howev , there is still work to be done in the futur .
this is the rout which europ need .
a new version of the document is current be written .
( the sit wa suspend at 11.05 and resum at 11.30 )

this is what we believ we are deliv .
haiti is one of the poorest countri in the world .
also , the intern communiti ha been hard hit .
in other word , this is not onli about save human live .
we have , in fact , to save the countri a a whole .
let me just veri briefli focus on four main challeng .
first , we have , of cours , to address humanitarian need .
what is in enough suppli is search-and-rescu capac .
that is alway veri difficult in these kind of circumst .
this is veri import .
our servic are work on this .
last , the financi respons .
then we will have to see where we stand .
now one is hear figur in the region of usd 10 billion .
the presid and major ngo are on the spot .
i will also go to the dominican republ .
that is all i have to say at the moment .
that is a veri welcom develop .
there should be some visibl eu presenc .
whi not battl group ?
can we convert that into a grant ?
so i hope you will put that on the agenda of the imf meet .
the human cost of this tragedi is immeasur .
it use to produc 90 % of it agricultur need .
today , it import more than half .
in futur , we must improv our procedur .
( applaus )
there is no question that there will be fund come .
i watch what happen in china .
we say , oh , the infrastructur is destroy .
of cours it is destroy .
how can this happen ?
what about an aircraft carrier ?
we salut all those men and woman who are involv in this .
the european union ha decid to releas some initi fund .
howev , we can not leav it there .
let u be frank .
europ must lead by exampl .
europ ought to demonstr it own effici .
i hope it is success .
mr presid , the horror of haiti is shock .
all of u here are well paid and can afford to give .
global ha destroy our industri .
the bank have ruin our economi .
that is not compass : that is stink hypocrisi .
do not be mistaken , this is not about wage a war of flag .
( fr ) mr presid , is haiti condemn to misfortun ?
we must beat fate .
that ha been conclus up to now .
final , the reconstruct phase repres an immens challeng .
we are perhap at year zero of a new era for haiti .
it is their develop that we are talk about .
we can help them in a spirit of partnership .
yes to partnership , no to patern and neo-coloni !
it distant remind me of a four-head dragon .
the red cross ha issu a warn call .
more import , what can be chang in futur ?
( fr ) mr presid , mr ashton , that is enough !
that is enough .
when is this go to end ?
when is the commiss final go to act ?
we just need to use them .
i do not say this light ; the commiss 's inact is crimin .

parliament will follow you .

forget the polit rhetor .
congratul on commit this amount of money .
what doe that do ?

( applaus )
yet we are a forc in the world due to our social model .
whi should we all act togeth ?
we have been left in the slipstream of the unit state .
poverti and desol were left in their wake .
the world leader at that stage promis eur 600 million .
onli eur 40 million wa actual deliv .
in my opinion , such talk is neither fair nor appropri .
here i refer , in particular , to health and educ polici .
we must also work alongsid local non-government organis .
we are the biggest donor , and yet we do not exist .
mr barnier 's report ha been on the tabl sinc 2006 .
what are we wait for to adopt it ?
what are we wait for to appli it ?
what are these peopl go to do then ?

the situat on the ground is dread .
mayb you can also help to get them freed .

befor christma , there were three dead attack in mosul .
i would appreci hear your posit on this , high repres .
the strengthen of the eulex is also import in this regard .
mani will never be abl to return .
religi fanatic there is recruit numer reserv of fighter .
iranian tyranni interven there freeli .
elect take place in a deplor and unfair manner .
the experi of iraqi kurdistan could be a use refer point .
this is a realiti of which we can be certain .
are the iraqi author not do just this ?
these decis are difficult .
i think we could help iraq great in this area .
that is clear of great signific .
we fulli support iraq remain a unifi and sovereign state .
i will feed that back to the commissioners-design .
it is for iraq to deal with .
just a littl bit more about energi cooper too .
that point wa well made .
honour member rais the question of the withdraw of forc .
that , again , is of signific and import .
go back to where we began , i am optimist about iraq .
we must ensur that we work consist toward that end .

how do we creat wealth in the acp countri ?
whi is that capit not employ in those countri ?

let u promot self-suffici .
there were some question on fiscal matter .
all area deserv equal attent .
mr cashman made a remark with respect to discrimin .
we have therefor fail in our develop mission .
someth ha to chang with this second revis .

this is within our power .
we can chang the mandat of our bank .
let u take action in this regard .

the european arrest warrant ha replac extradit .
it ha substanti cut the time need for surrend .
one ha lost his job and his famili 's main sourc of incom .
both are depriv of the compani of love one .
case like this give european judici cooper a bad name .
they pour shame on the inact of govern in council .
thank you , mr watson .
now this coupl is in finland .
this is one of those case .
there is , in fact , no trial date .
the term of imprison are burdensom .

they share a small cell with three other prison .
they are confin to their cell 23 hour a day .
they are permit three telephon call and one shower a week .
they are allow one famili visit per month .
in short , they are isol .
the languag barrier make the isol wors .
they are accus of a white-collar crime .
they are not murder or terrorist .
hungari must institut such guarante .
we must be more effici and more rapid .
this is not an academ argument .
the eaw is destroy innoc peopl 's live .
extradit ha now been reduc to a mere bureaucrat formal .
let me make a suggest .
the key concept is the concept of trust .
the estim of one year to enforc each measur is onli indic .
thank you , commission .
thank you so much .
the debat is close .
prevent traffick in human be ( debat )
the next item is the debat on
in 1850 , slaveri wa offici ban throughout europ .
popular opinion is also more or le of this view .
i would like to address two matter .
human traffick ha it own market .
the answer is yes .
we absolut agre that this is the right approach .
it is a veri import idea that must also be seen through .
the same appli to the subject of jurisdict .
you also ask u about prevent measur .
i now come to the help and protect provid to victim .
next i come to data collect .
final , i will end with prevent .
it is therefor time to react , and to react forc .
mr barrot talk about the need for new legisl .
we hope we will see the commiss propos veri soon .
the opposit is true , in fact .
my second point concern the protect of victim .
their right and their futur must be top prioriti .
i would appreci an answer to this question .
it must give them right and a new futur .
that is what i would like to see .
in addit , there are two other matter .
long-term wit protect programm are urgent need .
i have been plea to hear a unanim opinion express here .
now , let u take this a our start point .
europ should have the courag to call a spade a spade .
unfortun , howev , the number refut this .
unfortun , number have been rise in recent year .
thank you veri much for your attent .
in fact , it is a definit of slaveri .
traffick is today 's slaveri .
the ecr group welcom this debat .
mechan for victim support need strengthen .
initi must be robust , member state-driven and eu-support .
we realli owe it to all the victim .
our respons to it must be massiv and concentr .
the demand side deserv strict sanction .
it is also an intern problem .
it is a veri signific and serious problem .
consequ , we have to come down hard on those behind it .
they must be offer resid permit .
veri often , we do not want to see it .
they find it just too easi to re-traff these child .
this occur all over the eu and we must put a stop to it .
too few crimin are brought to justic .
third , the situat is not be monitor suffici .
we therefor need great polit will to tackl the problem .
it is happen in europ and we must tackl it from europ .
the first is victim protect .
onc again , i would like to thank all the speaker .
the debat is close .
the vote will take place at the februari i part-sess .
written statement ( rule 149 )
often , it is child who are in the greatest danger .
the eu must urgent tackl traffick in the labour market .
it is veri import to make a distinct between the two .
they are to be treat entir a victim .
eu member state must offer victim adequ protect .
what is clear is that the polit will is not there .

it is either one thing or the other .
one can not have it both way .
we must acknowledg that our approach fail .
we must say it , we must recognis it .
no , it wa not the right method .
the strategi wa bad , becaus the result is bad .
therefor , the strategi ha to chang .
there wa not enough room around the tabl though !
there wa scarc room for mr obama even .
let u do like the wto then ; it work for the wto .
( applaus )
moreov , we must , i believ , be realist .

this agreement formal expir on 31 januari .
this is the present situat .
it will be known to the european parliament on 25 januari .
this is what will be produc on 25 januari .
this is a procedur , a programm to combat terror .
there are two side to the coin .
these are thing that we regard a import .
care consider is also need here .
howev , we can not take that serious .
i will simpli take note of it now and then overlook it .

written statement ( rule 149 )
outcom of the copenhagen summit on climat chang ( debat )
we have share goal and strategi .
let u bring to bear our collect european experi .
this is no small task we are face .
our credibl is at stake .
we have to stand our ground .
on the other hand , the accord ha serious weak .
it contain no refer to mid-term or long-term mitig target .
adequ financ also need to be provid .
the same goe for global econom govern and intern secur .
we are inde at a crossroad today .
let u take copenhagen a an alarm warn of that scenario .
we must do better than that and we can do .
europ 's polit perform wa simpli poor .
the copenhagen summit wa a failur .
a a fellow member said recent , europ wa absent .
after this disappoint , it is import to regain the initi .
that onli increas the risk of the mistak be repeat .
that would be regain the initi .
this strategi must be firm , dynam and innov .
we also need a new form of climat diplomaci .
a figur of 30 % ha been mention .
mr hassi just mention 40 % .
what we need is a comprehens worldwid agreement .
i am fulli in favour of that .
clariti is need .
and i also wish commission dima everi success .
the world is cool .
global warm is a fraud .
this is not a victimless crime .
ladi and gentleman , of cours , copenhagen wa disappoint .
it wa not even mention in the copenhagen climat agreement .
that is whi it is a disappoint .
it is not .
it wa the first council configur under the spanish presid .
that is not a good sign .
the truth is we do not know the way .
we are stumbl around in the dark .
the commiss ha final put forward a draft decis .
it is a crucial test both for the commiss and the presid .
to achiev this , three thing must happen .
who will speak on europ 's behalf in mexico ?
third , the climat .
therefor , the eu must now promis 30 % .
the copenhagen confer wa a good exampl of a bad method .
and what were the lesson ?
instead of be a decis player , the eu wa a confus spectat .
what should we do ?
import barrier to punish both countri would be disastr .
final , we need serious research on the bodi of evid .
some member of the ipcc now even predict global cool .
we urgent need climat justic for the whole of human .
it is the same in poland , korea and china .
when are you all go to wake up ?
scam , scam , scam !
climat , mr davi , is what we all have to put up with .
( hu ) minist , i have surpris news for you .
the climat confer in copenhagen is over .
it end in failur .
no legal bind commit were sign .
the exampl of kyoto show what voluntar mean .
the world today is determin by econom fundament .
we need to chang the polit and moral climat .
everyon wa glow with optim , but it came to noth .
whi should this be ?
the u and china togeth account for almost half .
howev , in europ , we do not speak with one voic .
our big goal is a legal bind agreement .
howev , china and the u are opt for a differ rout .
of cours you would .
that is how the world should have react in copenhagen .
the eu should therefor demonstr leadership .
obvious , we can criticis the u .
it would be crazi to rais our ambit in the current state .
we need a strategi and we need a post-copenhagen agenda ' .
mr rehn gave an extrem good introductori address .
he is quit right in his conclus .
the eu must speak with one voic in these negoti .
we need a climat job strategi .
we current have a 20 % target .
it is even wors than this .
this is a posit we can not justifi to our taxpay .
we ask for too much and we have achiev noth .
let u avoid useless and cost specul about the climat .
the measur need for this , howev , have remain a mysteri .
time realli is run out .
it is up to u to now decid what happen next .
then we will at least have made a start .
so what should europ do now ?
so what need to be done ?
energi effici mean econom effici .
these can not be seen a a consol .
i vote against the resolut here in decemb .
i wa right , like 92 other here .
( applaus )
we are not at that stage , and we should be sorri .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
not much came of all of the plan that we made here .
it all went wrong in copenhagen .
it could also be call a defeat .
i am slight shock by some of the speech i have heard here .
simpli carri on and march forward is not the solut .
these were not the reason for this outcom .
what opportun did we actual have to present that ?
a second set of question also need answer .
are we use the right instrument to tackl this ?
this is a rather bureaucrat approach .
first , do not walk alon next time .
we must be abl to convinc other to be a ambiti a we are .
second , no one size fit all .
well , we certain know it : there is noth right now .
we had better unit next time , and that mean one voic .
we need a univoc mandat .
europ realli need one voic .
we need a reliabl diagnosi of the situat .
copenhagen stood for much more than a climat summit .
the grow influenc of the emerg countri wa evid .
the lesson from copenhagen should be learnt .
that mandat wa not success .
we can not pursu an ostrich polici .
thank you for your attent .
they talk and talk until they have all melt .
it is true that copenhagen wa not a success .
one thing is clear .
let u look at solut .
climat chang can not be resolv on the issu of emiss alon .
a sector , quantit vision doe not lead anywher .
what is more , we have to attach greater import to scienc .
how are we go to coordin on this matter ?
that is anoth veri import question .
we should have alreadi start work on that this morn .
we are lack that vision .
we are mile away from our object .
i am think here of japan and norway .
what will be the impact on that system ?
can you tell u that ?
( hu ) mr presid , we should not embellish thing .
copenhagen wa a failur .
that is true .
what do we need in order to achiev this ?
therefor , they can sell their co2 quota .
in copenhagen , poland and hungari suggest a compromis .
thank you for your attent .
in fact , the eu wa virtual inaud dure the final negoti .
so what are we to do now ?
europ must not miss the innov train .
that is the challeng that must be taken up by the eu .
it will be similar in mexico , too .
posit result should be achiev .
what is happen about the pledg insid the eu ?
what exact is happen ?
that is part of the problem .
that is whi the eu is cut out of the final negoti .
how are we go to resolv this ?
i am told that the same thing happen at the wto .
it is a big problem for the eu .
i am sorri he is not here for the final session .
this is how not to do thing .
let him put his money where his mouth is .
it must not be manufactur and it must not be invent .
if we are marginalis , a happen in copenhagen ...
( the presid cut off the speaker )
our busi must be competit in a world market .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
agricultur wa therefor hard touch upon .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
( the presid cut off the speaker )
we have conclud this session .
we must learn and move forward .
we must not succumb to complain .
i count on your support for this goal .
but let u also recal that our leadership start at home .
i can reassur you that we want to support 12 demo plant .
let u continu to put our own hous in order .
this must be implement in the come month and year .
this oblig chine manufactur , too , to chang cours .
this is an import sign .
these measur result in addit cost for busi .
they even constant increas their carbon dioxid emiss .
we need not onli fair ' but also green ' trade .
the copenhagen confer on climat chang wa disappoint .
the failur of the confer doe not justifi idl .
i can onli say that it is time the eu woke up to realiti .
it ha not play that role for a long time .
some progress ha been made , howev .
question time ( council )
the next item is question time ( b7-0002/2010 ) .
the follow question are address to the council .
subject : credit crunch/loan for busi
this is a problem that could becom preval across the eu .
it is do this is a systemat manner .
there are no restrict to suppli .

i suggest that you look at the rule .
( pl ) yes , that is precis what my question is about .
president-in-offic of the council .

i refer to the visa system earlier .
a you know , the commiss is work on the detail of this .
is it right to keep troop in kosovo ?
subject : devast of the tropic rainforest
this is a scientif debat rather than a polit one .
we therefor need to help promot sustain forest manag .
i would like to wish the spanish presid well .
i think you are off to a veri good start this week .
so , ¡viva españa !
i agre with the first speech .
i believ that this is in line with what we have said .
we must tackl tropic deforest in develop countri .
subject : european-level action on combat alzheim 's diseas
i wish to thank the council for the repli .
i do not know about the rest of europ .
what we are talk about is feed a tube into the abdomen .
the council spoke about guidelin .
i think that is the right place to deal with this matter .
i think that is the place and the forum .
that is what it is there for .
subject : corpor social respons ( csr )
europ play host to mani multin busi .
it is a veri suitabl place to take on this leadership .
it is necessari for all interest parti to particip .
the spanish presid will continu to promot it .
( fr ) thank you , minist , for your repli .
there is also a voluntari part made up of option practic .
some of them are alreadi oper .
i have some specif question in this regard .
we are use to so mani other type of label .
the path of sanction is not alway the best one .
subject : eu financi supervis
therefor , we will main be discus it with this hous .
these three committe should be up and run .
this is the council 's object .
( de ) thank you for your statement , mr lópez garrido .
i believ that there is a propos made by the commiss .
subject : econom situat in greec and role of the euro area
parliament know these articl .
they have no comparison anywher el in the world .
this is a veri clear exampl of solidar .
henc , there is solidar .
you refer particular to the treati .
this is what the treati ultim propos
that , of cours , is the respons of each state .
i believ that each bodi ha it own area of work .
that conclud question time .
( the sit wa suspend at 19.15 and resum at 21.00 )

democratis in turkey ( debat )
therefor , turkey must fulfil these requir .
there are sever chapter open for possibl negoti .

they are a tell exampl of such welcom chang and transform .
my veri warm thank to you .

how can we assist with the democratis of turkey ?
that is a big question .
i claim that this can be achiev by tell turkey the truth .
yes , turkey is make progress .
much of it is noteworthi .

turkey ha turn into a graveyard for polit parti .
thirteen parti have been buri by suprem court judgment .
it ha help the democratis and modernis process in turkey .
let u play it by ear .
who is call the shot on these arrest ?
turkey is an import countri that ha mani great asset .
it need and deserv democraci .
i look forward to welcom him soon in his new portfolio .
i have to say that i complet disagre with that .
word must also be accompani by action .
the eu should do someth about it !
this is hard a posit vision for a proud nation .
the european perspect is a drive forc for democrat reform .
our uncertainti ha a cost .
it could undermin the democrat process under way .
eu polici should never be driven by fear .
we european should support the reform .
there ha to be a clear light at the end of the tunnel .
i think we should pledg to support them on this path .
the result sever year later are , unfortun , veri poor .
( nl ) madam presid , turkey must be treat fair .
these must be met .
democraci is vital , of cours .
i met dink after the trial of orhan pamuk .

woman have also been treat unfair .
we expect a rapid respons .
trade unionist are prosecut and sentenc in sham trial .
polit assassin and violenc by the prosecut author continu .
elect repres are be persecut and jail en mass .
the ban on the activ of the parti is a typic polit ploy .
we therefor need to face up to realiti .
therefor , stop the negoti !
i regret that the eu fail to approach this issu thorough .
howev , that wa not what i want to say .
second , negoti .
that ha been irrefut demonstr .
third , a veri clear messag to turkey .
we must be veri clear with turkey .
that outlin the situat .
it depend on how you see it .

they have the most stabl societi in north africa .
econom , they are progress .
onli 7 % of the popul live below the poverti line .

( applaus )
that is the case , amongst other place , in egypt .
there are also huge divis econom in malaysia .
it is the most unequ societi in south-east asia .
the current govern rule on the basi of croni capit .

i am think of xenophobia and homophobia .
christian , too , must not be depriv of our care .
at stake is our credibl .
here , i make the same propos again .
the resolut we are adopt today should give a clear messag .
i find this difficult to believ .
the copt have been persecut in egypt for mani year .
howev , we should also beat our own breast .

it is , inde , a tragic case .
thank you veri much .
the european union is plan climat polici consist .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
to summaris : jew are the enemi of allah and of human .
the prophet say : kill the jew . '
such a situat wa incongru .
how is the eu protect the most vulner group ?
mr presid , i wish to speak on energi polici .
i therefor welcom recent initi from the uk govern .
i would urg colleagu here to do that in the futur .
we have heard that the offic are act on our comment .
now , i have noth against railway engin .
i believ that we can take the initi in start this dialogu .
we welcom all this .
i wish the congress everi success in it work .
we have here :
the third new element is the lift of bank secreci .
this aim is share by the report befor u today .
they are to be congratul on their attitud .
we have achiev a broad degre of consensus .
the hous is send out a clear messag .
amend have been draft .
all this is import .
we need an effect and ongo polici .
there are still mani problem to be dealt with .
we are also aim to increas transpar and cooper .
particular attent need to be paid to develop countri .
the other concern is transfer price .
this is also reflect in the council compromis text .
thank you , commission kovác .
mr presid , chanc often ha a hand in thing .
howev , this parliament will not let a contradict stop it .
yet that is not the case .
there is none so deaf a those who will not hear .
i wish him a happi retir .
have a happi retir , commission .
the major of countri in europ do not have bank secreci .
is there no way to keep the two issu separ ?
i trust he will understand befor the vote .
everyon is current concern about greec .
the committe ha work hard to ensur that .
ccctb is one of those propos .
howev , a my grandmoth use to say , that is anoth stori .
i will finish by also say a word of farewel to mr kovác .
i wa not here when you arriv .
you have therefor pleasant surpris u .
i wish you all the best .
tax competit is a jolli good thing .
it protect the taxpay from rapaci govern .
cooper would ceas and nation secur would be put at risk .
i urg member to approach these report pragmat .
we need to address and resolv this problem .
the second ha to do with offshor compani .
back then , we use to pay million of schill everi year .
i did not do it , but other did .
whi do we need anoth 200 new job ?
whi do we need to fund school ski lesson this week ?
what is all that for ?
these are matter of great import .
there remain much to do in this area .
the member state ' coffer are empti .
it relat to fundament choic .
an answer of which , i believ , we can onli be proud .
thank you and good luck .
first , high rate of tax .
the more exempt , the more fraud .
of cours we are in favour .
unfortun , this is an upward trend .
thank you .
tax fraud ha a major impact on nation budget .
stronger tax cooper is the onli way forward .
howev , it is certain worth the attempt .
howev , i do have three concern .
this is a matter of public ethic .
law must be straightforward .
this is an exampl of what can not happen !
tax competit is a good thing .
we may criticis the tax burden in our own countri .
i have been known to do so myself .
the most effect way to exchang inform is to do so automat .
the eu ha often been critic of tax haven of various kind .
it ha been a privileg to cooper with you .
you did not achiev it all , but you did your best .
thank you and good luck .
it is necessari becaus tax evas is no mere peccadillo .
it affect countri across border .
it may well be though that such purchas is necessari .
we have to consid that .
no , they are not .
we realli can not afford this .
these are highlight veri obvious in mr casa 's report .
there will be veri littl tax to cooper over .
that might be the pig .
onli that will lead to progress !
that also bring u to the subject of tax haven .
i know that these file remain a prioriti for my successor .
i also see general support for the three propos .
it is also now a prioriti for most member state .
in addit , a mr klinz ha right said , fraud is an offenc .
i also notic the abstent on the automat exchang of inform .
i would just like to make two comment .
the joint debat is close .
the vote will take place on wednesday , 10 februari 2010 .
written statement ( rule 149 )
propos should not interfer with subsidiar .
ani propos will need the approv of member state .
it is not an unimport element of this debat .
gm/opel : current develop ( debat )
the commiss ha monitor this question close .
it is not yet too late for this , commission špidla .
what doe this mean in specif term ?
the european commiss stood by a general motor triumph .
my second point is just a import , commission .
i believ we have an urgent need for this .
do they have good reason to hope ?
after all , it is inde a case of unlaw conduct .
we have alreadi held this debat , last septemb .
that is unaccept , commission ; these are vital matter .
this is the way peopl feel .
i expect more decis from the commiss .
let u look to the futur for onc .
what is the situat with the chemic industri in flander ?
car are becom too expens for peopl on lower incom .
all that you have done is defend the general motor plan .
in other word , there is no solidar between u .
it is even a threat to driver safeti .
radic chang is now requir .
spyker pay , but use money from the european invest bank .
for that is all saab ha been reduc to .
the commiss should reconsid it approach .
nobodi will understand that over there !
peopl want to understand what the european union is do .
the opel case is acquir one further dimens .
this mean that the german right of particip is be flout .
the commiss can not remain a mere observ .
i can understand their posit perfect well .
from my experi , i would point out a few thing to them .
that is absolut crucial .
i endors it complet .
( ro ) i would like to begin with three vital question .
what lie ahead for europ 's industri polici ?
which direct is the european economi 's competit go in ?
this figur is 20 % in countri such a latvia and spain .
this is whi i believ that this is such an import subject .
what doe this have to do with justic ?
what doe this have to do with moral ?
is this not a system that is fundament wrong ?
is there not someth structur wrong with this system ?
this ha met with a dubious recept from public opinion .
the ass of plan ex ant wa similar unconvent .
this is what we did and this is what we continu to do .
i believ that my successor will be no le strict in this .
the debat is close .
written statement ( rule 149 )
we must keep them in mind too .
let u turn to employ .
59.1 % of woman work today .
the lisbon strategi set an object of 60 % .
let u turn to patern leav .
i will finish , madam presid , commission .
by way of illustr , i will mention three of these .
some progress ha been made .
gender equal is not mere an end in itself .
thank you for your cooper and your attent .
i do not believ one can talk of a comfort ' major .
whi ha this discrimin persist so ?
the opposit is true in fact .
it wa not around when i wa young .
first of all , my compliment to the rapporteur .
let u just concentr on specif measur .
the green are veri happi with this quit progress report .
it is brim of plan that we want carri out .
we should look at that serious .
we hope that the commiss will take action accord .
it say that woman are of a lower status than men .
by the way , the four wit must be muslim , not non-muslim .
you have guess that i am speak about sharia law .
sure this is a case of blatant gender discrimin .
europ is bold march backward to sixth-centuri arabia .
howev , more job doe not alway mean more qualiti job .
sever question came up in connect with the report .
the most recent statist indic a differ of more than 17 % .
such discrimin is obvious forbidden by eu regul .
i wish you everi success commission .
we think that this is crucial for woman across europ .
the second point concern patern leav entitl .
madam presid , we femal mep are definit in a minor posit .
i would like to highlight two thing in particular .
i hope that plenari support the import of patern leav .
it is an easi solut to ask for new charter .
it is more of an effort to appli the exist instrument .
i have some question .
what would be the use of a new charter of woman 's right ?
what ad valu would it bring ?
there is none .
that would be intellectu dishonest and factual incorrect .
that is whi i am vote against paragraph 20 .
the charter is the main issu .
i want to emphasis three particular point .
we can no longer chang that today .
howev , it doe not refer specif to domest violenc .
i would like to quot from one recent agenc report .
the pvv want to see this backward combat with vigour .
it is time for a new wave of emancip .
we have to chang that .
it is the economi that is come up with all the solut .
it ha caus job loss and result in financi auster polici .
this also appli particular to immigr woman .
the matter of patern leav ha yet to be resolv .
thank you and good luck !
we must , togeth , make such propos .
we have the result of poll which show this .
mr presid , woman repres half of europ 's talent .
we must not wast this creativ potenti .
equal opportun do exist on paper .
the union ha produc at least 13 direct on gender equal .
critic mass is essenti to bring about chang .
import effort are be made and we need to emphasis that .
i can hard think of anyth new to contribut to it .
we need to creat the condit for that to becom a realiti .
quit simpli , our competit is at stake .
the eu should therefor learn from norway .
it is therefor sheer common sen to fight for equal .
let u also tri to take that path today .
under such condit , woman will undoubt hold their own .
we find similar result with other type of elect .
woman must not be in the role of supplic .
if they have an equal chanc , they will win through .
then there will be no need for quota .
i have heard this question mani time .
well then , in your case , we can talk about real equal .
that is not equal , either .
equal doe pay off !
we must look for the best applic solut for this matter .
there is enough materi here for sever debat .
today , howev , i would like to focus on two point .
i would like to emphasi one further thing .
i believ that these are import step toward equal .
i consid this report to be lack in balanc .
woman are better educ , but they do not gain promot .
third , the area of entrepreneurship .
this must be chang .
there are three conclus .
first , the monitor centr should look at best practic .
there should be equal pay for equal work .
the percentag of woman repres romania is 36 % .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
the reason is tradit .
it is cultur .
woman were seen to have an inferior , subordin role .
i think we have a lot to do in this area .
gender equal and woman 's right stem from human right .
ladi and gentleman , the debat ha been unusu extens .
exist legisl must certain be appli consist .
i wish you all the best and god bless !
a for the pay gap , mr bauer put it well .
it is , of cours , difficult to be precis .
the debat is close .
the vote will take place on wednesday , 10 februari .
written statement ( rule 149 )

inde , we are live in except time .
this is a time for bold .
our task is to use the new mechan to bring on new dynam .
and the answer is yes ' .
the answer is not yet ' .
frank , i believ we have to do more .
they are the fruit of our experi over the last five year .
this is no time for our institut to pull in differ direct .
also , sever of these issu impli cooper with the council .
i said we need to be bold .
i said we can not go on a if it is busi a usual .
today , a new chapter in our european adventur open .
( applaus )
the present wa given by mr barroso .
we are discus both of these matter .
legisl is not everyth , howev .
this key figur must be the voic of europ in the world .
howev , we must be ambiti .
( applaus )
that is an order that ha taken a vow of silenc .
that wa detriment in the hear for some of the new peopl .
( applaus )
this , howev , is the wrong approach .
the commiss is strong when it act a a collegi bodi .
they do not requir renationalis .
( applaus )
howev , mr barroso can not be blame for everyth .
( applaus )
for our part , mr barroso , we expect three thing of you .
( applaus )
that is the most import task .
be ambiti on this point , mr barroso .
come arm with ambiti project .
we need socio-econom govern of the european union .
( applaus )
we have befor u the coalit of hypocrit .
so , this is realli ...
that is a great polit strategi , that is !
( applaus )
i wish to say someth ...
i do not know whi you are get all work up , mr schulz !
you are not the presid of parliament yet !
calm down , my friend , calm down !
no , there are none .
this is not the way we do polit .
what ha been said is true .
that is the new mathemat formula of the barroso commiss .
no , it doe not work like that .
solidar , where is it ?
in spain , where is it ?
i have not seen it ; i have not heard it .
let me give you a piec of advic .
one of greec 's problem is it defenc budget .
4.3 % of greec 's gdp goe on defenc .
what is the problem ?
the commiss 's initi : it doe not have one !
the same point ha been made with regard to haiti .
we will not make progress like that .
therefor , i believ that we have a problem .
we want a polit europ .
mr verheugen is leav the commiss .
he is not say whi he did not play his role .
there are enough of them .
that is unworthi of this parliament .
let u wake up , becaus europ need it !
( applaus )
if you take this rout , you can reli on u .
i wish you much success in this .
you can expect no applaus for this from my group .
mr barroso himself wa a maoist .
now i could go on but we would be here for some time .
there must be certain nostalgia amongst the communist .
poor greec , trap insid the econom prison of the euro !
good know what that is go to do to them .
today we have share valu ' .
articl 121 will be invok with all of those .
you can laugh , you can smile .
it will not work .
it can not work .
we need democrat solut to this .
we must vote against this commiss .
they did not want to make a commit , to accept respons .
ladi and gentleman , let u press that restart button .
i would like to focus on the strong point .
let u not alway make ourselv out to be wors than we are !
we have an opportun now to make a good impress .
( applaus )
where econom polici is concern , we have a strong team .
we are count on this .
we disagre sometim , but we work well togeth .
that is the bottom line .
this is not the case here .
the commiss 's propos are not yet legisl for u .
we work on them so that our own idea , too , are incorpor .
it is a piti that this is happen so late .
mr presid , i hope it is worth wait for .
let me give an exampl .
word are not suffici , howev .
so that ha got wors .
quit simpli , it is not good enough .
we defend our independ and our right of selfdetermin .
how can they be dismiss ?
they can not .
the eu is a bureaucraci and not a democraci .
i am in favour of cooper between independ state .
each of u got vote ; i got 130 000 vote in finland .
here they might get 300 vote , but that is about it .
what lie at the heart of democraci ?
it is nation sovereignti .
this is a basic principl .
( applaus )
none of that is veri import or veri interest .
you are go to have mani peopl to deal with .
this will be a difficult polici .
mr presid , perhap i can correct mr gollnisch .
we all need to chang our attitud .
the european parliament also need to chang .
this , a far a my polit famili is concern , is unaccept .
unfortun , howev , this doe not surpris me .
there are two thing we want from you , mr barroso .
plea be courag and make europ strong , both insid and out .
the shortcom are clear .
greec need help , of cours .
for this , we need a strong europ .
i am plea that the commiss ha now put forward a propos .
you have our support to do so .
but in some of these nomin he ha been let down .
the singl vote must end .
i am not complet happi with the result of the impact ass .
the respons have been divid up .
which commission will provid this coher ?
plea do not tell u that it is the colleg that will decid .
we need clear area of respons .
you are not almighti and you belong to a colleg .
i have serious difficulti with this , mr barroso .
i do not yet know how i will vote later .
that will depend veri much on your answer to our question .
what is the aim of collect data on energi infrastructur ?
i believ we can not impos one-size-fits-al solut .
on this , parliament will support you .
mr presid , greec is on the verg of fiscal collaps .
spain and portug are also struggl with increas difficulti .
the way the system ha chang ha alreadi been mention .
it is the fourth commiss sinc i came here .
we want fair cooper with you and the commiss .
they repres bare 13 % of member .
otherwis , europ will not have a futur .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
for this , compet and trust are need .
the first aspect wa cast into doubt dure the hear .
can we trust the commiss ?
mani of u answer , and still answer today , in the negat .
that is not how thing are , howev .
there are , in fact , mani thing to be done .
my best wish , presid barroso !
he ha succeed in this .
so , mr barroso , do not be scare , be bold !
solidar among the member state ha never been so necessari .
the citizen ' expect have never been so high .
( applaus )
now , all of them will do so .
that is a good thing .
it furthermor rule out the sui generi construct .
you work with u on this and you work earnest on it .
the impact ass have alreadi been mention by other member .
you said that social impact ass are import to you .
that is an essenti point from our perspect .
i am complet happi with this .
i am refer here to the legisl monopoli of the commiss .
my second point is about the common extern action servic .
i am look at your vice-presid , ladi ashton .
we should be involv in the nomin of ambassador and eusr .
european voter gave a veri clear messag in june .
we wish you and the whole colleg of commission well .
that is exact what we expect from the new commiss .
at the same time , there are worri .
i hope it will be sustain .
they expect bold and clear project .
take foreign polici , for exampl .
present these propos to the council .
you do not have it yet .
they enjoy work extra hour .
it is up to them .
we also need to improv vocat educ and train .
that is a major task for the european commiss .
we have good reason for do so .
anyon can see what the reason are .
we need to take this action now .
frank , i think this is a case of extrem popul .
in my opinion , that is a wrong decis .
the commiss should be prepar for this .
the treati of lisbon ha introduc import chang .
what can we say after two month of it function ?
the point be that we need strong person and strong face .
we need strong institut .
they have help mani individu , communiti and busi .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
a great deal ha been said today about overcom the crisi .
then we will have overcom the crisi .
is it go to be mr van rompuy ?
is it go to be baro ashton ?
is it go to be one of the commission ?
i would like an answer to that .
the euro area ha been an area of stabil and job creation .
of cours , it wa affect by the crisi .
non-euro area countri were also affect by the crisi .
we have yet to reap the full benefit of the euro .
it is true that we do not have just a monetari union .
we should have a real econom union .
the period the euro area is go through is a difficult one .
there is no point in deni it .
let u also recognis that .
such analys usual come from non-euro area countri .
i am extrem commit to collegi .
in today 's polici , this is a normal tendenc .
more and more issu are transvers or horizont by natur .
so this is exact what we intend to do .
i think this is also critic import for the futur .
the cohes polici ha been enshrin in the treati of lisbon .
by it natur , it is a european polici .
i want to make clear what i have said public befor .
we believ we have made a lot of progress on impact ass .
this underlin how import we believ this agenda is .
it is veri import to relaunch the intern market now .
noth could be further from the truth .
i disagre .
that is not what we are propos .
there is absolut no doubt about that .
( applaus )
we are live in unpreced time .
where in the world doe europ count ?
it is respect in trade term , i can assur you of that .
we have a common polici .
we have institut .
we have the basi on which to act .
they think in term of strateg balanc .
and here , it must be said clear , europ can not be naiv .
on the contrari , we were by far the most ambiti .
for me , dimens ' mean depth , it mean scope .
it is someth veri ambiti , in ani case .
i wish to work with parliament in this spirit .
therefor , i say this with a great deal of convict .
we need the various institut .
she ha the respons and the abil to play that role .
that is our system .
some peopl would like a complet unifi system .
we have a system that is an improv on the intern system .
i shall conclud by make an appeal to this hous .
with power come respons .
let u be clear on this point .
some polit group said that they would vote against u .
i do not need that kind of support .
the commiss doe not want their support .
that , i do ask of you .
what is the real problem ?
let u be clear on this subject too .
some now wish to use this gap a a mean of lower our ambit .
( applaus )
the debat is close .
the vote will take place on tuesday , 9 februari 2010 .

where would you be now without the solidar stabilis ?
( applaus )
it is also necessari for u to ass this colleg .
that is one option .

europ is a perman compromis .

( applaus )
but let me also be veri clear .
high repres ashton , we ask you to use these new tool .

the lesson we learn from haiti is an exampl .

i can give you a whole host of exampl .
you will have it uncondit !
we made a mistak , and we admit it .
( applaus )
some distanc themselv from his own polit guidelin .
some group are disunit ; we are unit in that posit .
some of them made a thorough posit impress on u .
in what direct should the european integr process go ?
which measur are most import to the commiss candid ?
( applaus )
there is more .
i promis you , there is more .
( applaus )
but they did not need to use ani bullet to do it .
they were much clever , much more scheme than that .
then they gave 27 peopl total unlimit power .
these would have been the peopl who made all the law .
but they ignor the peopl .
but , still , the new bos would not listen to the peopl .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
yet , what are we be offer here today by the commiss ?
presum not .
yet , whi do you not want mr kara ?
becaus you are not allow to .
instead , we need more democraci .
( fr ) mr presid , my sentiment exact .
i shall be veri brief .
therefor , mr gollnisch is a innoc a mr dreyfus .
( the presid interrupt the speaker )
i should like to add someth .
i did not say that baro ashton wa a communist .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
thank you .
it wa onli suppos to be a person statement .
explan of vote
oral explan of vote
it ha right been said that parliament ha more power .
the commiss exercis exorbit power .
a well a be the european execut , it initi legisl .
yet , mr presid , that is the least of her fail !
no true european ...
( the presid cut off the speaker )
that is one point .
i wish them all success in their job .
quit honest , there wa no altern .
she would not pas ani examin at all in poland .
this is anoth reason whi i abstain from vote .
there is also anoth fact .
each commission is uniqu in polit histori .
europ is sleep-walk toward disast .
we are now govern by communist , collabor and quisl .
we need a commiss , and we have one now .
i think we would have a better team by do that .
mani have call for a strong europ .
that should remain the goal of europ .
written explan of vote
i hope it will not onli flourish but also bear fruit .
i have therefor decid to abstain from the vote .
furthermor , our ideolog are complet differ .
they are internationalist .
given the abov , i vote against the motion .
the barroso ii commiss is a mix bunch .
howev , there are other thing go on .
we can not support this unjustifi institut riski ventur .
what strategi will get u out of the crisi ?
how should we respond to the social and climat emerg ?
how should we reviv the european project ?
on that basi , it can not have our support .
of cours , i also vote in favour of it .
the vote today concern the colleg of 26 commission .
i vote in favour of the new barroso ii ' commiss .
it would have made no sen to reject the colleg .
i shall judg the commiss on it polit initi .
i do not consid the composit of the commiss to be ideal .
in write . - we all wish this new commiss well .
therefor , i abstain on the vote on the new commiss .
this is a strong mandat for the futur .
unfortun , some state are not guid by this attitud .
this is a danger tendenc .
five year ago , two candid fail , this year one .
research and innov are major drive forc for chang .
mr barroso commit to 3 % invest in research and develop .
the commiss ha made a clearer commit in this regard .
the commiss ha also reaffirm this goal .
barroso is not the power leader we need .
he allow five extrem crucial year to pas by .
year in which europ could have promot smes .
none of this happen .
that explain my no ' vote .
we can be truli proud .
the post of high repres is a product of the lisbon treati .
i do not approv of that treati or it creation .
it ha no democrat legitimaci .
there are mani nomine with communist background .
in the interest of the solidar of our group , i abstain .
this will save valuabl taxpay ' money .
mr barroso , you have shown skill in elect the commiss .
some of the commissioners-design are excel .
correct to vote and vote intent : see minut
approv of the minut of the previous sit : see minut
the euro area a a whole is no longer in recess .
it is , howev , true that job creation is fall behind .
each report will be subject to a commiss ass .
that is what we are concern about .
admit it is month too late , but it is absolut necessari .
we urgent need better coordin of econom polici .
the spanish presid is right to emphasis this .
he deserv our trust and we should give him our support .
that will need to be organis .
action wa taken far too late .
we have heard it all .
i therefor think that the approach ha been wrong .
final , my last point , which is about more than greec .
what doe this mean ?
if so , which one ?
greec ha to rais eur 31 billion over the next few week .
they have fail resound .
the crisi doe not onli concern greec .
the left warn against and oppos these polici .
there is a huge differ .
there is no point in creat a european econom govern .
clear , today , we are fail on that score .
yet what are we see today ?
this is what we must focus our attent on .
they are much bigger than had been thought .
the budget deficit is approach 13 % .
europ must not bring in a trojan hors .
the netherland made a start on this a much a a year ago .
the southern european member state have left it too late .
mr verhofstadt , could you plea also listen to me ?
europ had to and would expand .
what is happen now ?
you are continu a normal with your disastr polici .
who is knock on the door of the european union ?
poor countri that are also suffer under enorm corrupt .
mr presid , this polici of immigr must stop .
nevertheless , i will glad begin my speech now .
this should be a warn for ani countri outsid the eurozon .
join u at your peril .
we have to say how we have end up here .
are the stabil pact credibl or not ?
for these reason , each member countri ha it oblig .
we need to stop talk and start act .
that is what i expect and i trust them to do it .
unfortun , howev , noth of that wa heard here .
the specul did inde profit from your statement .
howev , they should not form this basi alon .
europ can not be left behind .
it is time for reform , imagin and integr .
common and effect rule and instrument are requir .
this is the wrong messag .
fruitless debat about aid is of no help .
when the euro wa strengthen , what were the specul then ?
euro-philanthropist ?
we need to look at what we are do wrong .
greek statist are also be discus .
in fact , the dollar and the euro form a duopoli .
a duopoli will alway be unstabl .
there will alway be movement between the two currenc .
greec or the unit state ?
what these countri need is solidar and the right signal .
polit manag is extrem import .
greec , portug , ireland and spain are the most affect .
behind them , howev , the entir euro area is at risk .
after all , that is what econom union is all about .
a a percentag of gdp , sipri report that greec wast 3.3 % .
is this realli the european dream ?
who is next , spain , portug , itali or ireland ?
for this , absolut crucial and forc measur are need .
this mean that our budget deficit must drop below 3 % .
and yet the spread increas .
the problem is that the market specul and specul wanton .
and what about the european commiss ?
seek it caus in the econom crisi is onli partial justifi .
mani of the caus lie elsewher .
how can we fight this ?
it is a test for the euro itself .
howev , the rule in my view have not been effect .
i wish you well .
there have been abund rumour in this regard .
whi ha this not been monitor more intens ?
the result is bankruptci .
the same appli to govern .
thank you .
natur , this immedi intervent had to result in deficit .
this wa not just a statist correct .
this is not a statist matter .
they are not ask eurostat to resolv it .
plain speak , that is what happen .
eurostat doe not compil the data .
eurostat receiv notif from the member state .
that is all i ask .
the support can not be free of charg .
that would creat a climat for futur imbal and futur crise .
the debat is close .
written statement ( rule 149 )
this system should function almost in real time .
sever question aris :
ladi and gentleman , greec will not manag on it own .
( the sit wa suspend for a few minut )
other gave background support .
other pretend not to see .
so it wa not someth that just happen over there ' .
the best respons to the terrorist is crimin convict .
europ must do more a well .
it appear this is someth more complic .
mr czarnecki , will you accept a question from mr hautala ?
in realiti , it is a transatlant cooper problem .
it wa made in the eu .
i therefor welcom this step .
in essenc , howev , we first need to clarifi three point .
what is it that we are not do but could still do ?
this is a figur that should be manag for the 27 .
it should be prais to the sky .
it is exemplari . it must serv a an exampl .
it is a respons to a wish express by europ .
howev , the european union ha much in common with this .
we are therefor in this togeth with america .
it affect all of u .
we all need to face up to our respons .
that is my first comment .
we have to ask what can be done about this .
the first matter is yemen .
it is import for u to be in line with this .
i believ that this is someth that need to be point out .
they were mention by the minist .
the debat is close .
the next item is the debat on :
first , there is the african eleph .
second , there is the asian tiger .
third , there is the protect of the polar bear .
up to this point , there is consensus among u .
i now come to the controversi issu .
that is the conflict that we face .
the common eu posit will then be adopt by the council .
the first is atlant bluefin tuna .
the second is eleph and the ivori trade .
when there are no fish , there is no catch .
bluefin tuna is in immedi danger of extinct .
so the scientif part of the debat ha been resolv .
now let u examin it from a polit and social perspect .
tuna stock are collaps .
the regul of fisheri ha so far fail to deliv .
the s & d group ha tabl an amend to this effect .
japan is stockpil en mass .
the mafia get involv in this busi .
conserv of tuna ' !
speci have drop by 80 to 90 % .
it ha fail complet .
the target which it ha set itself will fail complet .
appendix ii will make no differ .
there will be no tuna left .
that veri biodivers is crucial .
we have a strong resolut in front of u .
a fierc battl is be fought over this .
this is crucial for the surviv of this speci .
howev , i want to pay specif attent to just one .
the instrument work .
unfortun , this fish is now on the point of die out .
that is the current realiti .
that is whi quota do not offer ani comfort .
they make no sen , a a result of the illeg catch .
let u look at what the scienc tell u .
that is not the long term , that is tomorrow .
this is the real problem for bluefin tuna .
my countri ha been work toward this for year .
we need to get to the root of the problem .
in order to save fish , we need to save the speci .
the scientif inform can not be disput .
it is vital import that iccat is allow to do it job .
the measur undertaken by iccat must be care monitor .
that is certain not a sensibl way to proceed .
these includ tuna , cod and salmon .
in the face of such figur , the solut seem obvious .
my question therefor concern the condit of this support .
what is the commiss 's view on the subject ?
what will the new control and penalti measur consist of ?
support this certain doe not make feel me like a crimin .
that is someth that we should reflect on .
bluefin tuna fish is a global activ .
unilater viabil of tuna popul make no sen .
but it is clear that it is not enough .
in catalonia , hundr of job are at stake .
our propos is inde base on the scientif advic to cite .
i believ that this scientif opinion is crucial .
if not , then i would like to be told that .
on that point , i agre with the previous speaker .
it is possibl to reconcil these two .
if we do not ban it , then there will be noth to catch .
i advoc the need to control fish .
i also advoc the need to control mafia .
without this ident mark , there can be no trade .
i think we need to focus on the result .
the practic impact of such a list would be uncertain .
final , i will comment on mr kelli 's question .
is the commiss happi with scientif evid on mani issu ?
the debat is close .
the vote will take place on wednesday at 12 noon .
written statement ( rule 149 )
but do we have the same situat here ?
of cours , we have to be pragmat .
near 1 % of the labour forc would lose their job .
- c7-0095/2009 -
howev , there wa not enough progress .
rebuild in bad place solv noth .
the implement of these polici is not an easi task .
i am look forward to the debat .
inde , there are numer exampl of urban renov project .
so this is direct relev to britain .
we do not have the room .
it is about space , not race .
that would be blatant discrimin against the other group .
howev , that is precis what this propos doe .
immedi and joint action is need .
the eu ha 27 member state divid up into 271 region .
this is an alarm figur .
today , we alreadi have concret posit result .
now fund are to be disburs to all member state .
the public mood in britain is one of grow dismay .
unlimit , uncontrol immigr is feed public anger .
this is an emin european issu .
to own the hearth , the stool and all !
the new text stipul a rate of 4 % .
i firm believ that this financi imbal must be correct .
these are issu that we need to address a well .
the second step is the one be taken today .
i much appreci it .
second , two comment on the substanc of the debat .
the second comment on the substanc .
the debat is close .

the first concern the fight against corrupt .
we mean this and we believ in it .

we need to send out a clear messag on that point .
we welcom this veri much and are veri plea about it .
it wa a mileston in our cooper .
it repres open , interact and cooper .
this momentum is diminish day by day .
i hope this will also be this year .
where is turkey head ?
neither of these promis ha been kept .
christian writer and academ are have to go into hide .
when will turkey have to compli with the ankara protocol ?
these argument are loathsom and repel , and so are you .
i would like to emphasis two thing .
this is terrifi and it is a crime .
these are absolut crucial element .
i believ that our process must be total sincer .
i have one or two question for the commiss .
what ha happen to the negoti with turkey ?
whi are so few chapter open ?
let u not blame turkey for the eu 's intern difficulti .
i believ that this is happen in the current negoti .
whi is this import ?
bring in anti-discrimin legisl now .
we in parliament should welcom that .
but again , on anti-discrimin , i wish them to go further .
that seem rather strang to me .
howev , i would like to discus the subject of turkey .
turkey is move forward and backward .
let u take the exampl of the arm forc .
this is a good thing .
that , of cours , is not a good thing .
we think that is veri good .
there is also the privat war ' against the doğan group .
all of this is veri unfortun .
anoth exampl is that of the role of woman .
i do not think that this is the case .
howev , this is not an automat process .
our primari respons is to the european union .
this seem to me veri strang .
these are all area which are not exact margin .
this is veri import .
i recognis this and i am plea about it .
that is european law .
your hear wa truli superb .
a europ without that balkan lung is not europ .
this is someth which is , truli , veri import .
father still sell their daughter or swap them for cattl .
the men who buy wive treat them like slave .
the name issu is a real polit issu in greec .
this is a polit realiti .
see the last report of the un high commission for refuge .
howev , this is an issu that is still pend .
howev , it doe not succeed adequ .
some of the amend are posit .
greec must strike it own balanc .
my second comment relat to the word comprehens ' .
we must give a clear yes ' or no ' .
turkey is play a veri negat role in those negoti .
that is the path turkey is take at the moment .
the same appli to other candid countri .
when they reform , they are becom neighbour .
mr presid , greet to commission füle .
confidence-build is sore requir .
turkey should send signal .
the time to act is now .
we wish to speak the languag of truth with turkey .
howev , good intent are not everyth .
the rapporteur ha submit a veri balanc draft resolut .
that is a matter of credibl and moral author .
this is a veri import issu .
i should like to quot anoth of the council 's conclus .
( applaus )
the greatest problem of adapt , though , lie elsewher .
let there be no illus about this .
that may turn out to be the harder task .
howev , there are import differ .
access is and must be the ultim object .
howev , we can not have à la cart access tailor to turkey .
we expect an equal honest stand from the other side .
i wish you everi success in your work .
histori must bring u togeth and not tear u apart .
so-cal hate talk must not be toler .
in my opinion , the name issu should not come first .
one further point is also veri import to me .
howev , one thing is clear .
the process will never be linear .
we know this from the histori of the european union .
we should be awar of this .
a i have said , both side must fulfil their undertak .
turkey and cyprus are neighbour .
it is not just turkey that ha to make an effort , howev .
ultim , that is , of cours , what we all want : a solut .
( e ) madam presid , may i welcom the commission .
that polici should not be held back .
i would like confirm of that inform .
we are european citizen with european right .
croatia hand over all it want war crimin year ago .
it is hard to ignor the ambival of the cyprus issu .
we have not kept our promis .
that is a fact and we must resolv these doubl standard .
turkey , too , ha made signific progress .
that is one of the comment that i would like to make .
the second factor is privatis .
i would like to emphasis that onc again .
we also wish this for the countri we are talk about today .
the union 's institut refer to this countri a fyrom .
these provis are legal bind in term of intern law .
decis must be taken on the perform of the applic countri .
madam presid , i have a brief comment on turkey .
some of them are throw around unrealist date .
fals promis are detriment for both them and u .
let u be fair , let u be correct and let u be credibl .
the unit kingdom is full .
we have million of peopl unemploy .
the pressur on our public servic is incred .
the thought of turkey join is not on at all .
we have been deni a choic .
the peopl in our countri have been deni a vote on lisbon .
commission , it is your first day at work .
what can we do ?
i believ that to be veri import in pure psycholog term .
the negoti in themselv are a posit thing .
unfortun , it need more than a minut .
croatia will conclud access negoti this year .
we need instrument in this process .

the good news is that the elector doe not like it .
who could possibl disagre with cooper ?
it doe not avoid taxat .
what it tri to do is avoid doubl taxat .
it is time to stop this imperi .
thank you , mr presid . i want to stress this point .
the european union ha done it share and continu to do so .
it is the main intern donor .
we would have prefer her to hurri out there to do her job .
we would have like her to be in haiti help other .
we must also prevent the risk of child traffick .
onli rare can earthquak such a this be predict .
they happen unexpect .
a the old say goe , we are a strong a our weakest link .
now the solidar of the european union is also be gaug .
and what thank did they get ?
greec is on the verg of fiscal collaps .
it would seem that we in the eu are incap of talk to iran .
this be so , we need to find a new path .
we should see the futur author of iran a a partner .
the first reason is specif .
we have to deal with this subject again and again .
that must not be so : we need concret action .
this make of excus is irrespons and indefens .
this ha not been done so far .
we can not resolv addit problem without addit resourc .
we took a firm stanc at copenhagen .
that is whi we are take on this respons here today .
mr presid , i welcom the opportun to support this resolut .
the copenhagen summit wa a disappoint in mani respect .
the environ is altogeth too import to be left to the left .
mayb we should consid whi that wa .
for a start , we have two european parliament build .
we have come up with panic solut base on distort inform .
glacier are not melt everywher .
the gang delta is rise a a result of alluvi deposit .
how are we to explain this differ between the two union ?
we have countri that have run up big debt .
so , realli , what should we be do ?
second , it suggest an eu-level levi on taxat area .
the third point is on share inform .
we do not agre with this .
( pl ) mr presid , i , too , vote against this report .
i did so despit be a support of gender equal .
in my countri , abort is not understood in this way .
unfortun , i regret that i could not support this propos .
i think human life deserv better .
perhap they have not read it .
nurseri should onli be the last resort .
now , that sound pretti straightforward .
we all think we understand what that mean .
then it defin equal work ' a be work of equival valu .
how is an employ suppos to judg that ?
is it a question of how hard it look like someon is work ?
now we are talk about reproduct right .
there is an argument for all of these thing .
it is outrag for them to be impos on u by a court .
result - explos of eleph number .
( c ) mr presid , i , too , will be brief .
the recent elect have help in this .

an interinstitut agreement is urgent need .

swift tell u that is not the case .
the unit state administr tell u that is not the case .
there is no proof of what you say in this statement .
where are they ?
swift could be a use addit to these .
the idea is to divert attent away from this fact .
the interim agreement simpli could not be wors .
it is full of contradict and inconsist .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
colleagu , this is a veri import discus .

in this respect , i have three specif request or propos .

these are wonder word , but noth ha happen in practic .
what we are lack is cooper between the author .
that is where the problem lie .
third , we have just had a discus about swift .
this is anoth thought for the futur .
we need more secur in this area .
what type of technolog is be use ?
what type of radiat do they emit ?
can they caus damag to health ?
what do they allow peopl to see ?
final , can we ensur that the data is be protect ?
also , these scanner are expens .
if we are go to instal them , who will be pay ?
you also want to do this and present u with a solut .
we need to search for the bomber and not the bomb .
new equip is be introduc in itali .
the latest scanner also do not have ani effect on health .
the radiat they give off is le than that from mobil phone .
what is more , the scanner are also user-friend .
this email spoke of the post-detroit era ' .
no surpris there .
each machin cost eur 250 000 .
yes , we do inde need to investig terror .
i am sorri to say that these are incorrect .
is this where we want to end up ?
can there be ani greater mockeri of human right ?
i would like to say one thing first of all .
we are veri happi about this .
may i quot the onli one who is not here .
this is a serious fight .
i have been stop mani time at airport .
mr presid , back to bodi scanner .

what do these figur tell u ?
second , the war on terror ha fail .
it ha onli succeed in increas the problem .
we should anticip event , but we do not .
howev , there are also three institut element .
the first is cosi , the stand committe on intern secur .
even then , inform need to circul .
is this realli the case today ?
noth is le certain .
it seem that no one is will to deal with the subject .
we talk here about the cooper of the secur forc .
believ me , terror destroy live and shatter communiti .
what utter nonsens !
there are legitim concern about bodi scanner .
first , is it necessari and effect ?
second , is it or is it not harm to health ?
there are , howev , other concern .
initi we were told that it would be option .
i have two question concern bodi scanner .
no greater exampl of success terror exist than that .
ladi and gentleman , we now come to catch-the-ey .

i would like to see this ass complet befor we do anyth el .

europ ha a strategi for it counter-terror polici .
we are also keen to ensur the correct exchang of inform .
this ha been emphasis in the hous on various occas .

i believ these are the three topic that we need to examin .
( the presid cut off the speaker )

terror remain a high-level threat in the european union .
the use of bodi scanner is a delic issu .
it ha been establish that bodi scanner are more effect .
the problem is that they may offend passeng ' digniti .
therefor , this is the issu which ha to be address .
mani possibl exist .
the inform we are receiv about this make u veri sceptic .
this system ha prove it effect over mani year .
and when you dare to protest , they laugh in your face .
you would agre this is an abus .
a decis on compulsori use of scan equip must be made .
situat in ukrain ( debat )
the high turnout on both elect day wa particular encourag .
this is a signific achiev .

it is also an opportun for a new start .
it is now vital for ukrain to move forward .
much more should have been done in the past year .
we expect to see concret step forward .
action is need at mani level .
it is up to ukrain to choos the model it want to adopt .
we have mani tool to do so .
the eastern partnership ha brought addit tool .
but our offer to ukrain is not a one-way street .
madam presid , commission , we are rather disappoint .

the crisi ha not pas .
we in parliament need to reflect on that too .
i would like to return to these idea .
this ha an extrem power effect on employ .
now , i almost want to revers the issu .
this is the other side of the coin .
this can be seen clear in the current situat .
i think the present crisi will be a test for all of u .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
but what doe the commiss do ?
that , concret , is the prescript of the commiss .
capit can onli bring more suffer and crisi .
last year , the uk economi contract 4.8 % .
so did itali 's .
the german economi contract 5 % and eu trade much more so .
so what ha the eu done to bring this about ?
this is a three-fold increas in 4 year .
howev , this would incur a much higher social cost .
the current event in greec illustr this .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
if you believ the commiss , trade drop by 10 % in 2009 .
if you believ the imf , it drop by 12.3 % in 2009 .
( sv ) madam presid , our contin is a rich one .
these countri are thus extrem sensit to crise .
globalis and intern trade are fundament posit .
protection is an evil and ha alway been an evil .
we should act in a similar way on mani other matter .

( the presid cut off the speaker )
we must fight against ani protectionist tendenc .
we are also face a new world order .
i have onli two or three minut if i understand right .
have said this , let me start with a general remark .
i realli do not believ that protection is a solut .
hope , the major part is behind u .
i think that is the onli good respons .
so what we should do is becom stronger ourselv .
the debat is close .
written statement ( rule 149 )
this is the point at which we must start .
eu - south korea free trade agreement ( debat )
that is a veri good thing .
howev , the main protest are come from the car industri .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
free and fair trade form the basi for europ 's prosper .
we must therefor firm oppos ani protectionist tendenc .
the system must be applic in practic .
we want a decis quick .
in our opinion , at least , this should be includ .
what evid doe the commiss have to support this argument ?
the fta is current be translat .
the object is to sign the agreement in april .
mr caspari also made this point .
just take a look at the figur , commission .
the number and the trend are much too alarm .
we want improv trade in environment good .
all of these thing , parliament ask for .
is this a perfect deal ?
well , of cours it is not .
is it a good deal for korea ?
is it a good deal , potenti , for the world economi ?
mr presid , a you said , this agreement break new ground .
in this case , we see that the opposit is true .
just what do these figur mean , howev ?
i do not see in this agreement how this will be encourag .
we have heard them here tonight about the car industri .
the agreement will show our support for progress .
what are the key element of this programm ?
i actual welcom the free trade agreement with south korea .
south korea is an import alli in a strateg import area .
this is the first major fta .
this is a templat . we need to do it right .
there must be a level play field for both parti .
plea do not get me wrong .
i am a strong propon of ftas .
employe in the eu deserv better .
we did not think that event would prove u right so quick .
allow me to spot a connect there .
we expect answer from you today , commission .
where doe this figur come from ?
on what studi is it base ?
we must not be pressuris into act too quick .
therefor , it is my convict that we should act a follow .

onlin gambl in relat to recent ecj rule ( debat )
commission , we are veri plea to have you here .
that can not be right .
commission , that is the context of this question .
let me start with your first question .
you simpli have to face this fact .
how can we best prevent fraud and crimin activ ?
how can we best protect our citizen from harm ?
it is best to leav this to the compet of nation administr .
market surveil is also key , when it come to onlin gambl .
it is the europ which say , do a i say , not a i do ' .
the degre of legal uncertainti must be end .
with a new commiss we do hope for new impetus .
i have great faith in you , commission barnier .
it mean that gambler usual lose .
in addit , gambl is addict .
is it parent or someon el ?
it increas the risk of addict , especi for young peopl .
here we have a good opportun to demonstr this in practic .
is that the line you want to take or not ?
this beggar belief .
unfortun , mani peopl can not resist the lure of gambl .
that is the most import point .
internet gambl is , moreov , view a a grey area ' of law .
what would this number be across the european union ?
i look forward to hear further from commission barnier .
he enjoy race-go and obvious wa a man to place a bet .
clear there are two school of thought on this issu .
whether we like it or not , peopl enjoy gambl .
gambl is a vice that appear still today to be larg hidden .
good luck .
we are in a state of tension .
on the other hand , we can not abandon our sen of respons .
we must accept our respons .
we have to look at these thing togeth .
nor do we have ani clear definit , either .
the member state and the various oper are all involv .
it must do so by show the necessari determin .
if so , how will it be tackl ?
i am not an advoc of onlin gambl .
i would say more that i am against this activ .
we must protect minor and those who are vulner .
we must also prevent addict and avoid organis crime .
this is primarili a consum protect issu .
in my opinion , regul should focus on consum protect issu .
last but not least , allow me to make two propos .
there are upsid and downsid .
we need a common polici becaus gambl transgress border .
it goe right across the entir european union .
otherwis , they are mere aspir .
it is a complex problem .
addict to gambl is a major problem right now .
one studi ha found that peopl start gambl a earli a 13 .
gambl is a contemporari form of addict .
what direct should we take though ?
if need be , they can be ban from play .
protect young peopl is anoth problem relat to this issu .
howev , ban young peopl from gambl will not get u anywher .
i shall even remain a littl idealist .
ladi and gentleman , make no mistak .
of cours , i have been in offic for 48 hour .
it is this , therefor , that is go to chang .
i think that it is imposs .
i shall continu to listen to you .

order of busi
thursday :
we did not finish discus this in the group .
that happen in group sometim .
that is my person opinion on the matter .
( de ) mr presid , i would like to reiter my request .
there is no doubt that we are in favour of debat .
we are mere ask for the vote to be postpon .
mr lehn , i can not give you ani assur about the result .
( de ) mr presid , i will be brief .
i do not wish to go into the question of merit just now .
( applaus )
perhap 15 to 20 minut will be enough for you ?
so what ha chang ?
there wa littl opportun to develop a long-term strategi .
in realiti , it is neither .
where are we go ?
how to deal with our neighbour ?
who are our main strateg partner in the world ?
where do we want to be in 10 or 20 year ' time ?
these are vital issu .
i have a week meet with presid barroso .
i wa glad to find such a level of ambit around the tabl .
( applaus )
all this ha prove to be an import asset in the crisi .
hope for a return of the good old day is no option .
but we could never get back what we lost in the crisi .
minim chang , some kind of adapt .
i believ we can and must be more ambiti .
on the contrari .
this requir a joint effort .
these prioriti are not unfamiliar .
what do we need in order to succeed ?
first , the strategi must be comprehens .
second , our strategi must engag all part of our societi .
it is also whi we have been wise to reform financi market .
it should not be a question of a debat on compet .
what we have to see is the ad valu of a european approach .
that is whi we need to act togeth .
still , a lot of action will have to come at nation level .
we need strong and true coordin in the econom field .
in this european council , i saw awar of this problem .
a question for you there , presid van rompuy .
can we toler this ani more ?
the ppe group doe not think so .
what answer can you give them ?
consolid can not be achiev through tax rise alon .
we have to find solut to that .
it is import to determin what exact happen in greec .
today , we receiv contradictori inform .
i think there is onli one good solut to that .
we need a bolder instrument insid the european union .
it is still an intergovernment , open-coordin method .
the problem with greec are proof of that .
( applaus )
is that what you are advoc ?
( applaus )
i would like to pick up on an issu rais by mr verhofstadt .
second , a lot need to chang in greec , too .
there is the excess public sector , for exampl .
it is definit in need of reform .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
europ 2020 must not go the same way .
we now need to set a new cours for our economi .
onli competit busi and success entrepreneur can do that .
the stake could not be higher .
we are now enter a new era .
we hope those state will liberalis .
the bank have alreadi made more progress than the state .
who will have to find this money , though ?
the same work in the same place must receiv the same wage .
well , i am afraid what we got wa you .
( protest )
i would like to ask you , mr presid : who vote for you ?
( loud protest )
is this european democraci ?
( reaction )
a you said , mr chair , you would not like to be rude .
i prefer to go ahead .
mr chair , will you take a blue card question ?
that way , you will be happi .
mr presid , i am veri disappoint in you , mr buzek .
( applaus )
( applaus )
we have been call mental weak by danni cohn-bendit .
you know , it ha to be ...
it can not be one way ...
( the presid cut off the speaker )
mr farag , i am sorri but it wa not a person statement .
we must keep order and all the regul of our parliament .
howev , let u not get too work up about that .
the solut is not more europ ' .
i should like to congratul you on this in advanc .
they centr on a green , social , market economi .
the 2020 strategi must be built on such a foundat .
it would be a mild punish for the behaviour he ha exhibit .
howev , we need resourc if this is to succeed .
this need to chang .
we have had enough of that here today in parliament .
rememb , what is true for citizen is also true for govern .
freedom also bring respons .
not even 30 % is ambiti .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
( remaind of speech not avail for technic reason )
moreov , the commiss wa not courag enough , mr barroso .
there are no realli new approach .
for this , new framework condit need to be defin .
we need to think care about the climat object of the past .
you can be certain of our unreserv support .
first , that of know how we organis ourselv polit .
to achiev goal in public polici , a budget is need .
therefor , we are le abl to reviv our growth .
how do we solv this dilemma ?
this is the question i put to you .
it depend on two element .
is it a simpl name chang or a chang of direct ?
i address this in particular to mr barroso .
it is you we are count on .
they have both foot on the brake .
( de ) madam presid , it is easi to set fine goal .
that is what we need to see for the europ 2020 agenda .
the altern is that dramat .
( e ) ( begin of speech not avail for technic reason ) ...
we should be look at 40 % by 2020 .
it should not be the goal of a strategi .
you said veri clear that the market is not enough .
yes inde , we want a social market economi .
the monetari union is not enough .
we need polit union .
there are three thing i would like to see .
such propos have been put forward in parliament .
it is now up to you to final put these thing on the tabl .
europ doe not expo , it protect .
europ doe not suffer , it act .
mr van rompuy , the european union walk on two leg .
the member state and govern and the peopl .
we are look for the head , and you are the head !
thank you for be here , mr van rompuy .
you are a man of great qualiti .
do not fear the peopl and their repres .
love them and they will love you back .
those are the main shortcom of lisbon i .
i am go to highlight one object : the intern market .
no , a yet , we do not .
i will tell you whi .
privat sector demand is a long way from recoveri .
we are concern about public invest .
no , a yet we do not .
more than one countri ha made mistak .
i have one institut and one substant comment .
that must be the start point for all new strategi .
how to accomplish this ?
we know veri littl about that at this point .
through cohes , the eu 's competit will grow a well .
third , let u tailor the strategi to the countri .
that is what will lend credibl to the whole thing .
greec is not ask for money .
it is ask for someth el .
we must not buri our head in the sand .
( applaus )
these are worker who must be safeguard and protect .
befor we focus on new job , we must protect the exist one .
these issu have been veri well present here .
i have two question .
one exampl is the social aspect .
there are other countri a well , a we all know .
moreov , our countri ha never ask for financi support .
what it ha ask for and is ask for is polit support .
i will explain .
that did not happen dure the 1930s .
the crisi actual last until the end of the decad .
whi do we have this posit growth now ?
becaus we have taken measur .
we have conduct an intellig monetari polici .
in the 1930s , we had competit devalu .
we have not had them today .
i would even go a step further .
that mean that some budgetari choic will need to be made .
it so happen that they could be hard goal .
this is where it get difficult .
we therefor need a consist posit .
it is often said that we need more bind measur .
howev , we should think about this .
one final word about greec .
i believ that we have sent out the right messag .
it is take some brave measur .
in fact , everi crisi is a challeng .
we must learn lesson from everi crisi .
well , we will learn them .
( applaus )
thank you veri much , mr presid .
thank you so much for be here with u .
it is actual the econom model which need to chang .
converg between the region strengthen europ 's competit .
at the same time , we must make up for our neglect .
who is respons for this ?
furthermor , what about hour of work ?
or how do we want to increas product ?
we need a new approach to these new challeng .
the eu 2020 strategi must stand on two pillar .
the eu 2020 strategi must mark a breakthrough .
final , the european parliament must have an increas role .
the first concern themat issu .
the onli possibl is to blame the entir intern communiti .
howev , it should take a critic look at itself .
our thought and our prayer are with them .
i would like to refer to two other parliamentari prioriti .
first , belarus .
i would like today to stress mr milinkevich 's messag .
on the other hand , israel respect the right of prison .
book-burn is aliv and well .
the debat is close .
written statement ( rule 149 )
i have mani reserv about the unhcr 's overal credibl .
this investig should be in accord with intern standard .
we ought to bear this in mind when evalu this matter .
famili were destroy , and school bomb .
a popul wa thrown into panic , trap and unabl to escap .
gaza ha not chang sinc then .
the destruct remain and the sieg continu .
howev , there ha been the goldston report .
fatah and hama are not spare critic .
this parliament will not allow itself to be intimid .
light and justic , noth el .
that is inde veri disquiet .
we should not let it pas .
that is what we need to answer .
i stress that this report is complet unbalanc .
israel , too , ha that right .
when have we ever seen hama investig it own action ?
look at all the precaut they took dure the oper .
you onli need to visit the middl east !
it is beneath ani accept standard .
israel wa exercis it right of self-def .
not a word about that .
we should not wast ani more time on it .
this is part of a polit process .
this can not carri on .
put an end to this polit persecut of the state of israel .
so let u not tri to rubbish this report .
let u act on it .
for that reason , we call for an investig and for aton .
europ must not continu to look away .
this certain hold true for the conflict in the middl east .
this is whi the report ha simpli been ignor .
i believ we most definit do .
we should ask further question .
how can a state defend it citizen in such a situat ?
if so , is it possibl to avoid civilian becom victim ?
the truth is that violenc remain a disastr polici .
whi doe it allow impun to reign in this region ?
this report is not about israel 's secur .
this report is about major human right violat .
( nl ) this report is one-sid .
howev , hama misus these facil .
mr presid , i will conclud on a posit note .
that is to be welcom .
it is that simpl ; it just need to be appli .
the answer to all three question is judg goldston .
this is scandal !
it is certain not the one i have read .
i wonder just what report you have read .
that is the first step we should be take .
the polici of treat both side on equal term is not help .
there are wit to this .
we must not turn a blind eye .
the palestinian peopl are suffer .
we are allow the law of might is right to prevail .
over 1 400 victim in the gaza strip are obvious too mani .
it perhap doe not help ani further , either .
the european union must protect israel from it own demon .
goldston is a respect judg of consider reput , and jewish .
rather that ha been the ira and their polit repres .
it is also go to be debat in the human right council .
the debat is close .
the vote will take place dure the next sit .
written statement ( rule 149 )
civilian were attack indiscrimin and hous were bomb .
a dialogu must be mutual .
belarus is in the neighbourhood of the european union .
it is includ in the eastern partnership .
i think this messag must be made clear to the regim .
this is in a european countri in the 21st centuri .
this is the start point .
the second question is how we can achiev this .
we have seen that mr yanukovich ha been elect in ukrain .
how is this possibl ?
mr presid , a lack of a decis is also a decis .
this one-way street lead nowher .
a we hear today , these were most elder peopl .
it could have happen to ani other minor .
whi ha it happen to the polish minor ?
therefor , it start with u .
i would like to ask what we should do .
we , too , should proceed like this .
are charg for visa and a visa polici necessari at all ?
this is a defeat which ha affect the union 's credibl .
the european union is , today , a weak and undecid player .
this is not a pace of adopt intern standard .
therefor , i would like to say one more thing .
this is certain not accept .
let me make my fourth and last point .
in my case , it led me to the london school of econom .
the debat is close .
the vote will take place dure the next month session .
written statement ( rule 149 )
the belarusian author do not toler ani independ .
everi manifest of independ is treat a polit opposit .
thank you veri much .
the next item is the debat on the follow :
it took an overal view of woman 's condit and right .
that is whi we debat and discus .
no other word ha been propos to replac paragraph 9 .
i am talk veri specif about the europ 2020 strategi .
we have come full circl .
we will both take the floor dure the plenari session .
i think that this , too , is a veri strong symbol .
that wa the signal sent out in beij .
there are 12 action and nine indic .
the 15th anniversari of the beij platform for action .
both presid have just express their opinion on europ 2020 .
we therefor have no other choic in the matter .
we will do it togeth .
we are on our way , with the goal firm in view .
there is an old german say : mani road lead to rome .
equal need to becom a way of think .
this requir sensit and it requir the power of persuas .
in her resolut , mr svensson ha touch mani open wound .
mere declar of intent are of littl help .
howev , despit this consensus , the sequel is le stir .
we must not put up with the lowest common denomin .
we are still far from beij 's strateg object .
here in europ we still have a lot to address .
poverti is the greatest singl determin of health .
minor woman are experienc poverti , exclus and discrimin .
all of u will be behind you .
the fact is , woman form the major in both categori .
what we realli need to do is empow woman .
yet i would rather talk about that which is our task .
we have one tool in our hand , and that is lawmak .
it is evid that not everyth can be solv by legisl mean .
( pt ) i veri much enjoy listen to you .
i could list mani other case .
our strategi must consid the short , medium and long term .
there are two other issu which i want to mention .
could we be here if we had ?
last , let u acknowledg the woman of iran .
that is a good thing .
skill must be the key criterion , not gender .
where is the europ of human right when we need it ?
gender equal is an essenti principl for coexist .
onli yesterday , we had a meet with the commiss in madrid .
that will be the subject of the new york meet .
i make a call to all the men in this parliament .
plea join your voic to the voic of the woman .
the debat is close .

mr presid , we will get over this confus eventu .
howev , dog are guardian angel .
we must put an end to the massacr of stray dog in romania .
anyon who doe not love anim doe not love peopl either .

these worri i want to share with you .
i would urg the commiss not to ignor this import area .
the figur for young peopl is more than 21 % .
( applaus )
the commiss doe , howev , have a new mandat to negoti .

a he told u , the human right situat ha not improv .
in fact , it ha worsen .
the structur fund are not avail for immedi emerg measur .
it is fear that the number of victim could increas .

the european union must provid support in this situat .
we also need to look to the futur .
the planet is send u an so messag .
disast definit have no nation border .
i also call for immedi support for the victim in madeira .
my condol to the victim ' relat .

written statement ( rule 149 )
europ ha set this prioriti veri high on it agenda .
it is a veri import institut , polit and legal point .
i think that this is a mistak .

i am stop here .
( loss of sound )
i beg your indulg in this regard .
this data need to be aggreg at nation and region level .
this help prevent the disclosur of commerci sensit inform .
in my opinion , there are two layer to this propos .
current , the world use a littl over 3 billion m3 .
in 2030 , it will need around 4.3 billion m3 .
and i am worri about duplic in that area .
howev , it need to be reinforc with clear regul .
the commiss should carri out regular analys and research .
just a few word in conclus - or a my conclus at least .
and this regul is not about devi a polici on renew or gas .
the debat is close .
the vote will take place on thursday , 25 februari 2010 .
written statement ( rule 149 )
this is an import tool for shape a common energi polici .
i congratul the rapporteur .
the lisbon treati will provid such instrument .
howev , this ha given rise to debat concern the 20 % rule .
i am think main of two aspect .
this dual requir must be met .
this is a good sign that they have confid in u .
colleagu have rais some of those issu .
there are also other question .
were figur just pluck from the air ?
i think we should have been given that inform a well .
in fact , we should be given the global cost for that .
this is go to be a difficult decis for member tomorrow .

all that would achiev is to mean we would need more build .

i am sorri that you can not attend this workshop .
this workshop wa organis a long time ago .
i am realli look forward to cooper with you .
we need to reduc the overcapac of certain fleet .
we must leav our fear behind .
our common fisheri polici need to be reform .
the word in this regard in the report is good .
who realli think that the eu 's discard polici is justifi ?
i certain do not .
i am veri happi to see how far the reform ha progress .
in other word , exploit wa mandatori for eu member state .
a similar logic is in evid in the baltic sea .
a radic reform of the fisheri polici is need .
we believ that all type of harm subsidi must be stop .
the realiti of fisheri in the eu is complex and diver .
but the problem is how water are be fish , not by whom .
it just goe to show where the commiss 's interest lie .
regret , we are not live in this ideal world .
( e ) mr presid , everyth is at stake in this reform .
these includ specif support for small-scal fisheri .
support must be given in particular to small famili busi .
therefor , the environ must take prioriti .
final , i would like to make one more fundament point .
fortun , we have all succeed in find effect compromis .
we must manag fish stock in a sustain way .
but we must do someth about it .
i have tabl amend for which i seek support from colleagu .
if we do not get this cfp reform right ...
( the presid cut off the speaker )
new technolog must come to the rescu .
yes , we must evolv into a market economi .
that is not a view i share .
mr damanaki , we are count on you .
most fish stock are collaps .
the reform under discus is therefor absolut necessari .
protect of fisherman depend on protect of catch .
this further increas the urgenc of the need for reform .
i support the drift of the commiss 's solut : regionalis .
in addit , complianc with the rule is poor at present .
the good are the victim of the bad .
this is remark .
not that i wish to argu with it ; on the contrari .
there are import lesson to be learn in this regard .
all the import thing have alreadi been said .
i shall turn my attent to three point : first , overfish .
overfish is an undisput fact .
we expect the commiss ...
( the presid cut off the speaker )
from this perspect , i support all of the propos amend .
a complet transform of maritim polici is essenti .
first , a reduct in excess fish capac .
howev , the propos do requir further discus .
i have alway been rather fond of this organis .
it is set a gold standard .
the issu are similar .
it is also crucial for extern relat and develop .
that is what is need .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
( the presid cut off the speaker )
fourth , recognis past effort - most import .
fundament it seem to me that the key in term of the cfp ...
( the presid cut off the speaker )
we look forward to work with her .
mani famili depend on these fisheri for their livelihood .
tourism also play an import role in this respect .
we must take all of this into account .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
clear for them , the common fisheri polici ha not work .
therefor , the reform is most welcom .
that would make a huge differ .
have so mani speech is veri encourag .
small-scal fisheri and coastal region are a prioriti .
second prioriti : regionalis .
a lot of member state are implement this system alreadi .
these are our prioriti .
thank you for your contribut .
the debat is close .
the vote will take place today at 11.30 .
written statement ( rule 149 )
europ ha alway taken an interest in the fisheri sector .

i think there is great room here for develop a well .
this is an unaccept situat that should be elimin urgent .
economi exist , or should exist , to serv our peopl .
we do not exist to serv econom forc .
sever colleagu submit this request .
at the time , it did appar find a sympathet ear .
we gave the floor to about 35 of you .
( hu ) mr presid , i have the same complaint .
i have not been given the floor for six month .
i do not know the rule .
we alway sit through the debat and are sit here pointless .
for half a year , i have not had the floor .
i do not know of ani regul so i sit here in vain .
i would also like to thank the council and the commiss .
howev , we succeed .
we agre a solut for this dossier .
thank you veri much .
i am veri plea that we have this agreement .
i am plea that the commiss propos point in that direct .
initi , the transit period last until juli 2008 .
then the transit period wa extend to 2010 .
now we have agre to a new prolong .
the document cover mani area .
we have them .
here , the expens bear no relat to the benefit .
we should consid whether this kind of behaviour is right .
we have european regul that appli to everyon .
( de ) mr presid , commission , welcom to parliament .
now , for the third time , we are make an except .
this regul on pet will go down in histori .
that wa an uphil struggl , but it wa worth it .
of cours , we have also kept the balanc right .
they want to take them to ferret exhibit across europ .
the commission is look surpris , but there wa a debat .
it could be wors - it could be china , i suppos .
a a farmer , i know someth about vaccin .
in other word , it is an accid wait to happen .
such advic is wast on the commiss .
but we are in the right place now .
i think the futur is much more import .
it will be necessari to take measur in this area .
i welcom his statement to the parliament this even .
thank you all .
the debat is close .
written statement ( rule 149 )
revis of the packag travel direct ( debat )
this consult wa close on 7 februari 2010 .
the commiss is plan to present it propos earli in 2011 .
these element will serv a a basi for the impact ass .
this absolut must be chang with a new propos for a direct .
our law now must reflect this chang in consum behaviour .
travel compani must be mandat to provid veri clear inform .
updat this law is not enough .
now , howev , we are talk about peopl travel .
that is an import right in europ .
that wa 20 year ago .
a you said , commission , a lot ha chang sinc then .
anoth consult ha just been complet .
this kind of thing is unaccept .
we have alreadi discus bankruptci .
my final point concern consum inform on price .
we should fight this .
i think 20 year is definit too long .
travel need themselv may vari from countri to countri .
we can expect further strike and protest .
we need transpar system .
peopl live with disabl are given no opportun whatsoev .
that is whi i come back to my remark at the begin .
thank you .
everi challeng ha it opportun and risk .
whi is it out of date ?
( pl ) i support revis of the packag travel direct .
member who have spoken befor me have talk about this .
such a situat is not good either for consum or for busi .
all the rest is a matter for the free market .
final , anoth small problem .
the latter is onli liabl if it guilt is proven .
( el ) mr presid , almost everyth ha been said .
howev , i should like to focus on four point .
this direct is twenti year old .
the second is price .
the third is qualiti .
final , there is the question of secur .
that is what we want from the new direct .
for me , one of these criterion is the age of the child .
there is , final , the issu of bankruptci .
we need to do more so thank you , commission .
we are now in the middl of a consult process .
it is essenti to respect the impact ass procedur .
thank you veri much .
the debat is close .
taxat of financi transact ( debat )
some may say that doe not matter .
final , inde , are we right to mix regul with tax-rais ?
are these truli complementari ?
this is our first and prefer option .
final , the time of the differ initi .
i can not believ that .
take action .
that is what parliament wish .
plea do not misunderstand me .
i want to see more fund made avail for develop aid .
we must bear this in mind .
i hope that the investig will be both serious and effect .
it give u the possibl to have a dialogu .
that is someth that we should handl polit in our countri .
it is go to be interest .
transact cost exist befor ; they have been reduc .
if they have , no problem .
what is need is the polit will .
this , therefor , is the issu at stake here .
it must be worldwid .
let u be clear .
therefor , there is no point in deceiv peopl here .
i have an entir differ view .
citizen would understand this veri well .
tax financi transact will not hinder financi transact .
i suggest that you take a slight closer look at that .
that is true .
we await your courag and innov propos , commission .
you can choos between usd 20 billion and usd 200 billion .
it can be of a global and general natur .
that is not what it is about at all !
that must be paid for anoth way .
that is a misappropri i can not accept .
on transact tax , i have three area of concern .
first , the impact on end-us of financi servic .
second , the impact of the eu go it alon .
we know financi market are global and veri fluid .
we must be clear .
the bank must pay off their debt to govern .
that is the crucial question that we must answer .
i think that togeth , we have develop a veri balanc text .
thing must be coordin intern .
that is go too far .
we should also be honest with ourselv .
that is the right approach .
in do so , you have our full support commission .
now we can not allow that to happen in the futur .
we must put an immedi end to this lethal specul .
we need , therefor , to start take action .
howev , the question of sourc of fund is not enough .
the effect of guidanc are equal import .
should there be earmark ?
i would say yes , but what for ?
we must resolv all these matter .
plea give u an answer quick .
it is therefor necessari to formul a common respons .
commission , can you provid u with a timet for this ?
there are , moreov , sever reason for that .
it is a mistak .
the issu of european or global scale hard matter .
it also avoid resolv the issu .
what would happen if onli europ had this kind of tax ?
there are sever element that must be taken into account .
end consum are the one who suffer with a new tax .
second , there is a seri of technic problem to discus .
those that do not matter .
can anyon tell u the cost of this implement ?
how can all this be control ?
all these question are still to be answer .
i doubt the new tax is the right one .
this , a we know , did not materialis .
the number of global polici object ha , howev , increas .
we have to be care when face with multipl object .
let u not tri to make it all thing to all peopl .
this measur could prevent the accumul of specul capit .
thank you .
there are current twenti million environment refuge .
we must seiz this opportun becaus the time is right .
first , the analysi of the competit aspect .
third , we need to get the analysi right .
i have to say that it is not so simpl .
we are carri out an analysi and analys various instrument .
the debat is close .
written statement ( rule 149 )
implement of the singl euro payment area ( sepa ) ( debat )
not much ha chang and now i bring mine here in march 2010 .
those are the commiss 's own word .
bank have not pick up fraudul chequ practic .
that is the fraudster 's charter .
it is not satisfactori to be done countri by countri .
that is the cross-bord fraudster 's charter .
one of these is the singl euro payment area ( sepa ) .
that is what i believ .
an expiri date would inde have sever posit effect .
a deadlin presuppos legisl .
i can confirm for you that it will be base on legisl .
nevertheless , i would like to make sever comment .
we did the same for visa .
the fourth point relat to the futur of govern .
the first meet will take place in the spring .
there is an explan : the cost .
there are two issu involv .
whether it actual work depend on two thing .
that is our approach to the discus .
mr presid , it is good that we have the euro .
thank you .
that is confirm by the draft resolut .
i therefor confirm my commit to set that deadlin .
the debat is close .
that is exact what ha happen in the meantim .
this direct we are now discus date from 1978 .
i will stress again that the valu is practic zero .
they onli oper on a region or local basi .
besid , the singl market is not an end in itself .
it is import and it is good that we have it .
we should adopt this report .
so , here we are .
whi is this measur import ?
mr lehn , you spoke of sever billion euro .
we are all in favour of simplif .
what is the outcom of this situat ?
that is not just a problem of competit .
we were promis these propos for 2010 .
they can do this a the regul is option .
it seem that it ha veri limit reach .
in the uk , we have over 1.7 million micro-firm .
mr presid , i will just answer in one word : yes .
small busi need to have administr simplif now .
mr castex ha alreadi refer to this .
i would like to take this point further .
micro-ent are often not so tini .
the organis of our busi environ is cumbersom and fossilis .
look at the tradespeopl in china and india .
and look at our tradespeopl .
how do you make it work ?
mani of u collabor on the small busi act .
there are reason for this .
is the new regul compat with basel ii ?
the cross-bord activ of micro-ent would be hamper .
otherwis , there is a danger of a loss of transpar .
micro-ent , moreov , can not afford this effort at all .
this would reduc the unemploy problem in europ .
there are various reason for this .
thank you .
this ought to be the first step forward .
we can not alway demand someth and then subsequ say no .
i have spoken with mani micro-ent .
they are hope and wait for this regul .
i would like to restat my convict .
i think - a mr lehn said - that we need this oper sign .
final , i think that the timet is veri import .
this propos can be implement quick .
let u not wait .
that is the philosophi behind this propos .
we need time for that .
we will see what we can do about that with the council .
i have six basic comment .
the first concern the impact ass .
we wait week , but did not receiv a repli .
the seventh direct also concern merger .
that is high complex and veri difficult .
my sixth comment relat to the posit of busi associ .
all the other are in favour .
the debat is close .

report on competit polici 2008 ( short present )

this is the best result ever .
we must elimin these barrier togeth .
the consum market scoreboard is also of mr kuneva 's do .
it is still in it infanc .
what are we talk about ?
we are talk about the intern market .
at the moment , we can not afford to lose this opportun .
progress ha been made here a well .
it is all about peopl .
this will be our work practic .
we have a long way to go in this regard .
it now need to be translat into concret action .
the same appli to cooper with author in third countri .
european solut are need .
the situat in franc is far wors .
this is the wrong approach .
that is not the case .
not ani kind of consumpt , howev .
we expect you to make progress on this matter .
( the presid interrupt the speaker )
this ha been proven veri clear onc again .
onli then will it function in the right way .
this is still lack at mani level .
we therefor need to work harder in this area .
solvit is a veri import instrument in this regard .
we therefor wholeheart support mr buşoi 's report .
solvit can provid an import and key addit in this respect .
in this regard , you can count on our support .
although we support them , we do have one point of critic .
sustain is veri import here , a are social issu .
it must be a comprehens review .
i can not but notic , howev , a certain absurd .
a legisl , our primari concern must be citizen and consum .
we could not agre to it in those circumst .
this is whi it is import for solvit to be develop further .
member of the committe were horrifi .
it is import that solvit centr are well staf .
the intern market is at the centr of what bind u .
we can come back to that , howev .
anoth good thing is the focus on enforc .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
we are europ .
the intern market is not yet complet .
it still ha a lot of potenti for develop .
let u make this act a hallmark of the intern market .
the third strength is the competit export economi .
we also have a few tension to resolv .
i am plea that commission dalli is take this up .
we need a function market in health care servic .
balanc , reason and correct rule are good for consum .
of cours , promot is not everyth .
i would like to draw attent to sever specif matter .
this would appear to be a crucial matter in the report .
i would like to focus on two crucial point .
that is often the case , but not alway .
howev , there are also uninform consum .
we need better inform .
it is not enough for the packag leaflet to be readabl .
we need continu inform .
someon ha just said that we need confid .
howev , confid come from knowledg .
that is mention in the report by my fellow member ...
( the presid cut off the speaker )
thank you .
i think possibl and probabl the latter .
i think this would be a posit outcom .
that is an impress statist .
that bring u to the solut that are requir .
obvious , there is a shortag of staff .
that must be dealt with .
they must have proper resourc .
consum also need to have greater awar .
the second point concern solvit .
the intern market is someth which we need .
it can not be said that we have this at present .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
( the presid cut off the speaker )
a standardis credit form is also an extrem posit move .
mr presid , consum protect : we are all in favour of it .
that need to be look at so that there is proper staf .
the second one relat to busi directori .
( da ) mr presid , thank you for a good debat here today .
solvit is work well , but it could work better .
mr presid , i will conclud by mention three specif point .
this is the approach that i shall be take .
i support mr gruni 's idea of organis consult and seminar .
the commiss will care evalu the differ option .
we should not be afraid of it .
we should not react negat to the word market ' .
i would like to add a few point of my own .
i believ that solvit offer consum a practic solut .
solvit is a network which is alreadi oper well .
this is whi i am ask all group to vote for this report .
thank you .
the joint debat is close .
the vote will take place short .

that is a good sign , a you start your new job .
second , a parliament , in it last debat , unanim ...
( the presid cut off the speaker )
how much will each develop countri give ?
how and when will it be provid ?
that is , of cours , a key issu .
what would it requir ?
of cours , nobodi should be naiv .
we should know what we are do and we should not be naiv .
that is what we will be look for .
i am not say it is go to be easi .
this is not scienc .
( de ) i wish you a veri warm welcom to this hous .
my question to you is a follow .
my second question is a follow .
do you have an opinion on this ?
first , i am not here to repres the ipcc .
i am sure they are perfect capabl of talk on their own .
we still need , i believ , substanti progress there .
that is not my approach .
i am the politician .
there are still mani thing to be work on with the et .
( de ) a veri warm welcom to parliament , commission .
i also have a question concern the kyoto protocol .
what is the futur for the kyoto protocol ?
i think that is a veri good point .
we all know there are problem with the kyoto protocol .
in the end , it is also a challeng for the european union .
we can not stand there alon in the kyoto protocol .
we are not the problem vis-à-vi the kyoto protocol .
we deliv befor anybodi el .
the eu in this context is not the problem .
we should be care .
whi should it be u that kill the kyoto protocol ?
i think it is a natur thing .
i would veri much like to work with parliament .
i think it is a logic thing also vis-à-vi the citizen .
we two commission are alreadi have this kind of discus .
i understand your point on big citi .
( da ) madam presid , welcom , mr hedegaard .
i am go to focus on the thing that i disagre with .
is it the head of state ?
or is it the codecis procedur , or what ?
i hope that this strategi can be revis .
listen , that is not someth you need be concern about .
( de ) commission , i have two specif question for you .
is it possibl that we complet overestim our influenc here ?
second , your paper is remark .
that is the think behind this paper .
we are depend upon other .
that chang the whole dynam substanti .
we should be more flexibl in the way we negoti this .
that is my concern .
we can not just put it off .
what are we hear ?
there wa not enough time .
i hope that you understand that .
thank you all for this disciplin debat .
thank you , commission .
i am sure that will be the case .
the debat is close .
written statement ( rule 149 )
we do not need a war .
it is easier to ruin a countri than to rebuild it .
we acquir the expertis and experi .
i have , therefor , three question for mr hedegaard .
there are two aspect of this worth highlight .
i think that we have learnt from the failur of copenhagen .
second european rom summit ( debat )
all this is provid for and financ by the state .
the commiss welcom and activ support this initi .
two year ago , the first summit wa held .
how far have we got ?
you can see a glass a be half full or half empti .
this is not an issu that can be solv by a simpl slogan .
it need a lot of concret work .
they should lead the concret commit with agre target .
other will be organis in the futur .
howev , we have talk about this comprehens approach befor .
the chang in the region develop fund are import .
and we want to see high-qual public servic .
the emphasi here must lie on educ .
european fund can and should at most provid a help hand .
what we need are medium and long-term polit initi .
let u take action now .
so what is the result ?
school is an import tool for this .
there is no way out without creat job .
we have never specifi genet or ethnic label a a reason .
we need to find the way out togeth .
kosovo ha alreadi been mention here .
respons can not be local .
they must be global .
the averag age for the first pregnanc is 17 .
onli 10 % of rom woman use contracept .
educ must be a major prioriti .
howev , they are not one .
mr presid , there is veri littl to add - just a plea .
mani countri are singl u out becaus of this issu .
we understand a well that it is a question of polit .
access to educ would provid them with a real opportun .
howev , effort must be made by both side .
thank you .
europ need an effect long-term rom strategi .
it is not a fund issu .
this is whi i support the strategi of the union .
howev , the same appli in revers .
everybodi ha a right to a dignifi life .
rom child , to a predomin degre , do not have that .
now , we do have instrument ; we do have polici .
the question is , how do we utilis them ?
i believ that we do not need a rom direct or a rom fund .
i have heard mani of you speak about school .
( hu ) mr presid , we have a technic problem .
so there must be some problem with the comput .
plea inform the technic servic .
thank you .
zoli , is it the same for you ?
thank you .
the technic servic will take note of that .
the debat is close .
the vote will take place at the next part-sess .
written statement ( rule 149 )
so far , we have n't had ani coher strategi .
it should be promot at nation a well a at european level .
i am convinc that the basic tool for tackl this is educ .

subject : road death
but , of cours , further effort are need .
the commiss is determin to move forward with this propos .
drug drive is an increas problem .
10 000 peopl die everi year a a result of these accid .
i propos to the commission that we must do a lot more .
we do , of cours , need more .
my other question concern heavi good vehicl .
i should like , therefor , to ask you two specif question :
sinc when ha the european ertm standard been avail ?
which countri score best ?
ertm specif have been avail sinc 2000 .
i have one more question for you , commission .
so i think that we should look veri serious at this issu .
this is a veri complex question .
a european system of measur qualiti is a good idea .
subject : daylight save time
first , in 1999 , from 2000 we abolish turn the clock .
we chang this regim and maintain one time regim .
in 2002 , we turn back and again introduc summer time .
so , i have veri person experi of this .
one thing wa that the daylight disappear in the even .
peopl did not like this at all .
peopl are happi and this question ha not been rais again .
it can becom more complic .
subject : the freedom/secur balanc
doe the commiss agre with this ass ?

( fr ) mr presid , i fulli understand the time requir .
that conclud question time .
( the sit wa suspend at 19.50 and resum at 21.00 )
implement of the first railway packag direct ( debat )
that is not a failur of this parliament .
today , we need to know mani thing .
transbord european passeng train will be stifl .
we need direct action and we need it now .
so there are some posit note a well .
liberalis wa intend to allow new player onto the market .
that wa the theori .
i have one more question for the commission .
of cours , we now need to consid whi this is the case .
that is complet the wrong way to go .
in addit , you have mention newcom .
howev , the hoped-for market liberalis fail to materialis .
now to the matter in hand .
i have not heard one yet .
what is he call for ?
he is call for privatis .
i believ that this review is long overdu .
that make an effici and honest ass extrem difficult .
howev , it is not onli necessari to make an ass .
that is my question .
this appli to qualiti , too .
perhap the caus lie here , or the problem is this .
i am think of the matter of safeti .
from this point of view , safeti is , inde , increas .
a for me , i am plea about this .
good transport , howev , is anoth matter .
trans-european network are urgent requir .
austrian railway now travel this rout five time a day .
so we can see how absurd thing sometim are in this area .
i just want to repli to some remark .
we will pursu the same goal with the recast of the packag .
we must chang that system and improv interoper .
that is the purpos of develop this railway reform .
the problem is precis that this ha not been complet .
you can not then expect a high level of qualiti control .
mani member mention the need for invest .
the debat is close .
written statement ( rule 149 )
anti-counterfeit trade agreement ( acta ) ( debat )
mr presid , each institut ha to defend it role .
therefor , we must take action in this area .
the negoti must continu .
we need the success conclus of an appropri agreement .
mr presid , commission , i have three question on my mind .
so whi is this , commission ?
there is also the question of compens .
would you plea provid answer to these three question .
i total agre with the critic level by my fellow member .
such an agreement will affect the whole world .
lay the negoti document on the tabl straight away .
all i can say to you is welcom to democraci .
i hope that ha come across quit clear .
we have seen leak purport to be offici document .
but what we are ask for is reason transpar .
whi can we not have access to these document ?
whi can we not have access to the text ?
will there be crimin sanction ?
is the eu posit to support this ?
those attempt have been systemat block by other countri .
that is not unusu .
we have done this in accord with the framework agreement .
my credibl a a negoti is at stake .
final , you also ask about an impact ass on acta .
well , i think , a they say , up to a point ' .
it is not a blank chequ for copyright holder .
the democrat legitimaci of these negoti is weak .
the mandat ha not receiv ani parliamentari approv .
parliament mean busi .
acta is an issu that peopl on the net realli care about .
they are furious at the complet lack of transpar .
this is not how it should be in a democraci .
i hope the resolut will be adopt by an overwhelm major .
nevertheless , i will now turn to the matter in hand .
i demand that the negoti are broken off immedi .
is there anyth more ridicul ?
this show utter contempt for parliament and the public .
what is the commiss up to in that secret kitchen ?
are they there to safeguard their commerci interest ?
yet what about the interest of european citizen ?
could it be that they are le import ?
this is where the import of the pvv becom clear .
we gave the commiss no mandat for this .
do you realli believ this will happen ?
that is signific more than the european union 's budget .
this jeopardis our busi , promot crime and destroy job .
that certain can not be in our interest .
that is also an unaccept risk .
after all , we will be ask to give our approv .
i have three import question in this regard .
what have you done sinc then ?
noth , absolut noth .
howev , the actual scandal is yet to come .
a the commiss , you are the guardian of the treati .
we can not but worri about fundament freedom .
commission , put this agreement on the tabl immedi .
we have enter a new era .
that , commission , is the wrong way to go .
what can be said about the content ?
i have no doubt about it abil to start again .
the result of this polici are now quit clear to see .
i have no ipod , so there is no problem yet .
it is a littl bit too far .
interest question , what about china ?
the debat is close .
the vote will take place on wednesday , 10 march 2010 .
written statement ( rule 149 )
the commiss itself can not make head nor tail of it .
at the moment , this is not the case .
howev that is an issu for anoth day .
here , of cours , i refer to the infam three strike ' law .
access to the internet is itself a fundament right .
it must be treat and protect a such .
regul appli a scheme of generalis tariff prefer ( debat )
what is our start posit ?
we also need an evalu of the exist system .
have the export figur also risen ?
are the right countri benefit from this system ?
i have three question for the commission .
first , the current regul expir on 31 decemb 2011 .
we do not know .
what result ha the gsp+ shown ?
we have no idea .
such an investig is , howev , provid for in the regul .
plea tell u that .
we can treat this in a number of way .
you should receiv this document in april .
this provid for an unambigu and imparti review process .
think , for exampl , of the recent case with sri lanka .
this system must be review .
so , commission , plea speed thing up .
even for gsp+ , we may be abl to introduc a few improv .
second , how are we involv civil societi ?
parliament should also initi an investig in this connect .
i am think of china , for exampl .
the next step will be the joint resolut .

this close attitud is unworthi of this hous .
howev , we must recognis that each european union ...
i am sorri but i think we have heard enough .
thank you so much , mr uspaskich .
i have cut you off .
it is time for respons and courag .
at the moment , howev , it is more like a wish list .
( hu ) i vote against the eu 2020 strategi .
moreov , it imperi concept is clear evid .
this is whi we vote against .
that is , someth that is not true .
this is the reason whi i vote against the report .
( nl ) mr presid , the goldston report is too one-sid .
unfortun , goldston make no mention of that whatsoev .
( fi ) mr presid , i vote against the goldston report .
i would like to comment on one point .
actual , the situat is much more complic .
would that have been a proportion respons ?
they have been strip of all context .
mistak were made .
the opposit is the case , in fact .
it ha our support in those effort .
( pl ) i vote in favour of adopt the belarus resolut .
this is not true .
they are democraci , human right and freedom of opinion .
we have to bring this messag home in belarus .
certain not !
we do not need a financi tax .
this eu tax propos is unconstitut .
shame on them .
( el ) mr presid , thank you for your patienc .
written explan of vote
reliabl inform must be maintain in order to obtain credit .
this situat will be detriment to veri small enterpris .
this measur is thus inappropri .
cut red tape is import in this context .
i welcom the decis adopt today .
the activ of micro-ent are of neglig cross-bord signific .
i vote against the lehn report and the commiss propos .
for these reason , i vote to reject the commiss 's propos .
i regard the commiss 's propos for simplif a posit .
i vote for this resolut .
in short , a new lea of life is need .
let u hope that the eu 2020 strategi will provid it .
the 2020 strategi is suppos to replac the lisbon strategi .
the greek crisi serv to reveal our lack of solidar .
eu polici can not be mere the sum of 27 nation polici .
this strategi must generat the creation of job .
this doe not mean forget about industri or agricultur .
we must resum the re-industrialis of europ .
the reject of our motion for a resolut is regrett .
we shall vote against this text .
one of these target is an improv in environment condit .
europ is not the world 's most competit economi in 2010 .
whether the 27 capit cooper is anoth matter , howev .
penalti on the one hand , and incent on the other .
i believ that european expect more from this parliament .
i prefer that text to the three largest group ' compromis .
i therefor emphat vote in favour of this resolut .
i abstain .
howev , our polici is not a neutral of indiffer .
the same caus are the launch of rocket over isra citi .
this serv a an obstacl to a full resolut of the conflict .
it ha met with numer accus of partial .
this is not a good time to adopt a resolut on israel .
the eu can not hold relat opinion regard human right .
the european union ha open up to belarus .
unfortun , this ha not happen .
everi ineffect solut will be evid of our weak .
the resolut wa unanim adopt .
i wa plea to hear the result of today 's vote .
adopt of the document by acclam ha a special implic .
today , we have sent belarus a clear signal .
we are now await a respons .
howev , how is the bank sector go to respond ?
this is onli a small step , but the messag is clear .
a waitandse polici will get u nowher .
we must show the way .
that is whi we abstain .
the exact method of calcul still ha to be specifi .
this is consider progress .
public administr ' migrat to sepa is below our expect .
in write . - i vote for this resolut .
how will we abl to do it if we are kept in the dark ?
it is a catastroph violat of individu privat properti .
togeth , they decid to approv a confidenti claus .
that is whi we vote in favour .
fortun , that agreement did not see the light of day .
last , acta must not compromis access to generic medicin .
this absenc of inform is a caus for concern .
we want greater transpar from the european commiss .
it implement is unsatisfactori , howev .
the report call for :
instead , i support demilitaris and zero armament .
this seem to be a neo-coloni approach .
europ is divid on this issu .
the report :
the path of peac requir a break with these polici .
it is not a debat for the eu a a separ multilater entiti .
no other major chang were vote .
i , a i said , abstain , togeth with the rest of my group .
i have vote against the report .
the project is not target against russia .
these consider have form the basi for amend 34 .
i am plea that this amend wa approv by 358 vote in favour .
nuclear disarma at intern level is of vital import .

you underlin the fragil natur and environ of the arctic .
likewis , we - the eu - have been rebuf for observ status .
this is a good basi on which we can build .
but thank you for the start .
on the one hand , we are concern .
the region ha been compar to a canari in a mine .
methan speed up climat chang even more .
moreov , the indigen peopl are larg be ignor in all this .
a number of them have been mention .
we in finland are familiar with condit in the arctic .
we live there .
they can also live in the arctic if they wish .
howev , we alreadi know all this .
global warm ha caus the ice to reced signific .
it speed up climat chang .
that is certain true .
this ha to be a veri import principl in arctic polici .
i would also like to tie in to what mr gahler had to say .
mr gahler , you spoke about the potenti for conflict .
this is undoubt true .
it will not do a a govern structur .
in do so , he becam a byword for arrog folli .
this involv a refus to accept scientif realiti .
some eu member state lie within the arctic region .
( lt ) today , we are debat a veri import matter .
until now , no arrang ha been appli to the arctic region .
most urgent in my view is the arctic .
he went and he discov thing , becaus he wa an idealist .
i wish you some ideal in your work .
this proposit is entir bizarr .
and , by the way ...

( pl ) madam presid , who will take control of the arctic ?
respons - i stress this .
thank you .
the ice cover ha alreadi shrunk by half .
europ must activ involv itself here .
we need cooper , not confront .
we now move to the catch-the-ey part of the debat .
i wish to make two more point .
in addit , the global climat system depend on it stabil .
i , like you , come from the unit kingdom .
the onli differ is that i wa elect and you were not .
will you now be take u into an ice war ?
you have proven alreadi not to be capabl of do this job .
plea do the honour thing and resign .

it will be my third trip there .
the debat is close .
written statement ( rule 149 )
a spectr is hover over the arctic .
the spectr of global warm .
the european union must adopt an unequivoc posit on this .
the cold war show u how strateg import the arctic is .
cuba ( debat )
this must be the european union 's commit .
it is therefor our person , our most genuin person .
first , there is polit dialogu .
human right are univers and have no border .
( applaus )
let u focus now on save live and on human right .
this text doe , howev , have signific ad valu .
let u be veri honest .
this is part of the agreement .
i therefor appeal to you .
we did not do this for the militari coup in hondura .
is this be condemn ?
is this be discus , vote on and condemn ?
what is happen with the civilian victim in afghanistan ?
what is happen with the persecut in the western sahara ?
no ! we will not be part of this hypocrisi .
whi is this ?
we must show that we are in solidar with the cuban peopl .
we must be the voic of those who now have no voic in cuba .
( applaus )
that doe not make you a crimin or a traitor .
zapata 's death is no isol incid .
what fate await him ?
when is the cuban govern go to alter it posit ?
no govern can control or govern it peopl 's think .
ha cuba not alreadi had year of experi of this ?
polit dialogu is the onli instrument for move forward .
the cuban govern must take care of the cuban peopl .
depriv citizen of their freedom is a crime .
they never requir imprison .
howev , human right are non-negoti .
this should be our commit .
it is , of cours , the same commit .
we must demand the releas of all polit prison .
this is whi we should cooper close with washington .
( applaus )
we expect this of the spanish presid .
it is in everyon 's interest to avoid such a scenario .
which path will havana choos ?
the key to this is to be found in cuba .
a the minist said , this clear should not have happen .
( pl ) liberti will triumph in cuba .
the same appli to cuba .
we should definit not take this path .
what will we actual write in this resolut ?
now we have 27 member state .
the situat in the world ha chang .
in 2005 , the council suspend the 2003 measur .
over all this time , repress in cuba ha continu .
there have been no chang or reform .
nevertheless , polit dialogu ha been maintain .
i will conclud with two point .
the common posit ha not hinder dialogu .
this is obvious .
can anyon say that this progress is take place today ?
can anyon realli say that ?
the judgment of histori is clear .
the ruin of the homeland are safe .
do not worri comrad .
now we are go .
in fact , this fund ha help to keep tyranni aliv .
the first step must be the releas of all polit prison .
it is import to make this point .
the immedi releas of polit prison is quit difficult .
i believ this is the way we need to continu .
and we should also continu meet civil societi .
the debat is close .
the vote will take place tomorrow .

solidar is a two-way street .
the world economi need stabil .
that is the european way to do it .

( applaus )
i shall go further , mr presid .

( the speaker wa interrupt by a heckler )
it is the economi - yes , it is .
i realis that .
that is whi i said what i said befor .
we have achiev the singl european market .
we have achiev the euro .
i do not think that we have achiev anyth el in common .
that is whi you also see me with the euro-scept .
do you not see this a a contradict , a hypocrisi ?
becaus it doe not appear on the offici agenda .
is it that everyth is connect to everyth el ?
the wall ' street fell .
lead the union mean seek a solut for greec .
everyon ha said so and i am not go to repeat it .

we feel that timet is hopeless optimist .
it is a recip for disast .
we need a sustain social and sustain exit strategi .
the danish labour institut ha produc figur today .
that can be avoid .
we have to avoid it .
( lv ) thank you , madam presid .
thank you .
i should like to make two propos :
we gave billion to the bank in a bid to get the bank roll .
i hope that we do not have a mission imposs on our hand .
how much of the structur fund ?
that is the right path to take .
not the other .
now it is be assert that the blame lie with specul .
le than one thousandth of global cd deriv relat to greec .
that is just an excus .
( applaus )
solidar that help greec to accomplish what it ha to do .
that is the crucial thing .
nobodi ha ask for money to be put on the tabl .
we need a carrot and stick approach .
green job lie at the heart of the eu 2020 strategi .
nevertheless , we have a problem .
there should be emerg loan and noth more .
i hope we shall also look at medium- and long-term solut .
mr merkel also appear to be push thing in that direct .
i heard mr langen interpret the treati .
yes , there is the treati , the letter and the spirit .
madam presid , two thing .
the first concern public financ , and the second competit .
now we see the result .
that is up to the head of govern to do this week .
we have seen the result .
no , she did not understand it at all .
there is no meat in it .
plea provid some evid that you are abl to acquir new fund .
plea fight for a financi transact tax .
stay strong and creat european instrument !
mr verhofstadt say that specul are at work .
greec consum it .
i have one more thought .
we should talk posit about the euro .
the euro is a major benefit for everyon .
that is whi i am in favour of this major , strong currenc .
of cours , we have been talk about this for a long time .
our intervent therefor need to be free of ani specul .
we must act swift to help greec .
europ must do so in the interest of europ .
i think that it lack financi consist .
he wa right .
sure greec will be threaten today .
now , howev , it ha fulli assum it respons .
the greek peopl are pay a heavi price .
howev , we must not hide our head in the sand .
greec is not the onli countri in emu face serious problem .
the crisi , ani crisi is the mother of chang .
so let u not shoot greec down .
thank you for your attent .
europ 's integr process is not irrevers .
we must now acknowledg that that wa a major mistak .
that is incred .
the whole world is watch everi day what is go on here .
it is rapid fail .
it is their case .
it is their caus .
i am sicken by what i have heard today from mani .
greec is the problem at the moment .
the rollercoast will start .
mark my word : the problem is here to stay .
it is the problem .
it is truli imprison in the eurozon .
this should be a warn to countri outsid the eurozon .
join it at your peril .
onc insid , you will be lock in for ever .
( fr ) madam presid , i have one observ and three propos .
my three propos concern greec 's recoveri plan .
last , it ha been said that greec 's account wa flaw .
it is not onli in greec that account are flaw .
the time ha come for a decis .
i wa listen veri care to the call for better govern .
third , europ ha econom and financi stabil .
such a failur will not come about in the european council .
moreov , we are go to look further ahead .
we are go to look at the short and the long term .
clear , veri import progress is therefor be made .
it is also work close with the commiss and parliament .
you refer larg to the econom issu .
written statement ( rule 149 )
we also need to set clear long-term object .
the eu ha credibl and liquid .
it is even a matter of duti .
an end need to be brought to the public argument .
we await a joint answer from the summit .
greec is an exampl that europ must learn from .
greec is not beg .
the european union must retain it global competit .
veri clear .
i know that they will .
he ha left u with our mouth water .
first , that it should be clear and simpl .
in other word , do not let u make thing complic .
be flexibl , plea !
we should not rais fals hope or creat misunderstand .
a procedur for advanc conform ha been discus .
i think that it is someth that should be consid veri care .
let u allow the public to have their say .
the crucial thing , howev , is what form we give it .
that depend on the form that we choos for this measur .
we need three level of admiss check .
this is by way of encourag .
briefli , i have a second piec of encourag to mention .
whi should we avoid the issu ?
let u tackl what the citizen are ask u head on .
the low turn-out at the eu elect speak volum .
what is this european citizen ' initi , in essenc ?
this new tool should be correct use by be fulli exploit .
furthermor , it credibl must be assur .
in this respect , serious requir need to be address .
the collect signatur must be verifi appropri .
the second topic is the admiss of the initi .
are they mutual inclus principl ?
i would realli like to know the outcom of the meet .
so , thank you veri much again , vice-presid .

let u continu .
this doe not compromis our right .
such initi can indic what citizen consid import .
i think it is not just a fig leaf .
the citizen ' initi is like a newborn babi .

that is what we must alway bear in mind .
but this need to be a transpar process .
it is extrem import that the treati are compli with .
mani thank for that .

we hope that there will be a finish propos by the summer .
that is import in order to meet the expect of the citizen .
mr presid , i am veri happi with the citizen ' initi .
we must not let this opportun slip through our finger .
this is a practic contribut to european democraci .
this is where the problem aris .
that said , i am not here just to give prais .
first , we european are technolog advanc peopl .
i would like to go a step further .
we now have a right of initi for the citizen .
so perhap we should be grate to the eu for introduc this .
i think not .
mass migrat ha made this difficult to achiev .
and whi not ?
that is an import consider .
mr kamal is not here ...
it is a paradox that affect democraci itself .
a mr kastler also said , this initi must be appli .
there are mani thing on which we all agre .

despit this , the claim persist .

this is embarrass .
if we fail to adopt such a posit , we know what happen .
i agre with the high repres in this regard .

( the presid cut off the speaker )
against this backdrop , we must ask ourselv two question .
i see no reason for thing to be done differ in this case .
this hous is awar that the irish state coffer are bare .
would the irish govern be prepar to do someth about that ?
and whi is that ?
becaus it ha mani fault .
a well a that , the direct doe not mention schedul flight .
that conclud this item .
the next item is the joint debat on :
there will not be a repeat - a second chanc .
we have to establish veri mani thing at the concili meet .
whi el is 2011 so special ?
the margin are veri small .
young peopl are alreadi the drive forc and futur of europ .
this is a veri difficult moment , especi dure a crisi .
we have part adjust , but some work remain to be done .
what remain are the modal in the concili committe .
here i am refer to head 1a and head 4 .
brussel , too , must watch how it spend everi public euro .
howev , these guidelin are also a veri realist first step .
we are do onli half a well a we did in 2000-2006 .
on the other hand , it could be a reserv .
last , regard the seventh framework programm .
so the question is whether deliveri will be satisfactori .
then we can plan the budget accord to the situat .
we have so mani need in other area a well .
so are those reserv or not ?
inde , those prioriti leav much to be desir .
in itself , this choic of prioriti is someth to be welcom .
the problem is that in polit , the devil is in the detail .
how are we to implement it ?
it is our respons to tackl unemploy .
mani of them are fair well educ .
they onli lack job opportun .
no propos for an increas in the budget should be toler ...
( the presid cut off the speaker )
i would like to concentr on two aspect .
the rapporteur ha produc a balanc propos .
the cohes polici is not a form of do-good .
otherwis , there is no greater wast .
i hope that there will be progress in this regard .
thank you for your respect attent .
the initi report wa perhap understand vagu and general .
i am sure all member will take that point on board .
it should not be a unilater decis .
i call on my fellow member to support these propos .
i am count on you .
thousand of cancer victim are deni expens life-sav drug .

i would like to comment briefli on both report .
parliament should be take a lead .

i would like to say three thing about the eu budget .
my second point is about save .
then there is the second seat in strasbourg .

young peopl must be support both at eu and nation level .
job retent and creation should receiv most attent .
yes , that wa low-level in 2009-2010 .
let u hope also for a fruit concili of the 2011 figur .

work on the 2011 budget is under way .
request for the defenc of parliamentari immun : see minut
that is my intent , in ani case .
i am delight at what mr cioloş had to say .
the report had four , or rather five point for debat .
first , the joint european union logo .
i therefor ask that we support the specif eu logo .
the second point is the question of the place of origin .
the fourth element : the organ logo .
on this there is complet agreement .
there is much in it that is to be commend .
it is sure a decis for consum .
i would also like to see some chang in paragraph 16 .
otherwis , it is worthless .
so there is much in this report to like .
i would echo mr lyon 's comment on the eu logo .
i am against the introduct of an eu qualiti logo .
what i support is countri of origin label .
qualiti cost , and farmer need a fair incom .
we need protect geograph indic and design of origin .
whatev happen , these must be retain .
madam presid , first , may i declar an interest ?
i am an egg produc .
regul must be honest implement to a common standard .
that is essenti .
an eu-inspir crisi will short hit the uk egg industri .

now present u with a good text .
do so quick ; we have faith in you .
where a product come from is import .

there are special product like this all over europ .
we have to ensur that they find their way onto the market .
european standard have a global reput for be veri high .
unfortun , not all consum are awar of this .
the same appli to the size of pizza .
i would serious warn against overregul here .
therefor , let u focus on qualiti and not packag unit .
howev , there are a few aspect capabl of enhanc qualiti .
this lead to unfair competit .
a wa right emphasis in the report , this ha to chang .
we are thus in a right old stew !
they are complet overwhelm by the label jungl .
you are right about that .
i would like to address two point .
howev , produc want and need these rule .
consum must not be dupe by fraudul label .
take china , for exampl .
thank you for your attent .
it is therefor not my intent to merg for the sake of it .
madam presid , ladi and gentleman .

the debat is close .
the vote will take place tomorrow .

social partner ' involv can bring tremend ad valu .
an act of god prevent her from be here today .

the voic of europ need to be heard loud and strong there .

agenda of the next sit : see minut
closur of the sit
( the sit wa close at 23.15 )
open of the sit
statement by the presid
the next item is the joint debat on the follow :
i hope that a good balanc ha been found .
i believ that the ecb ha respond fair well to the crisi .
this is someth to build upon .
we must strengthen that account .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
the report 's messag in this respect is veri clear .
first , we need effect instrument for econom coordin .
we are ask you to submit a correspond propos .
it is a union of share destini .
monetari union is not a matter of conveni .
let me conclud .
today , europ face further pivot decis .
they might , howev , have becom somewhat too topic recent .
it ha shield our citizen from econom turbul .
i also count on your support in this matter .
we can also make better use of exist instrument .
this ha been use in the past , probabl too rare .
that is the second core element of reinforc econom govern .
today , the worst may be over .
unemploy ha not yet chang for the better .
therefor , this is inde no time for busi a usual .
i have learnt two main lesson from this crisi .
there is limit coordin of budget polici .
let u be auster , but let u also be invent .
this crisi is far from behind u .
they will exacerb unemploy and will fuel social tension .
i would like to talk to you today about the euro .
the euro pose no risk to the mediterranean economi .
those who do best can not be penalis .
where are we ?
so what we believ is that we should realli switch gear .
of cours .
what doe that mean ?
greec ha 4 % of it gdp go to militari spend .
they have got an air forc that is a big a the luftwaff .
i mean , how come ?
we need more integr .
so i believ that europ is now at a critic junctur .
so that would be our contribut to this debat .
howev , the euro doe not sit in isol .
it come from tax receipt from the privat sector .
germani realis this .
henc , it is now in a strong posit for recoveri .
ultim , the public sector ha done it job in the crisi .
that is preposter !
this is what we are call for .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
on 25 march 1821 , greec wa born .
yes , certain peopl must be call to account for this .
thank you , sir .
your time ha run out .
( de ) mr presid , i would like to rais a point of order .
mr trichet and mr rehn were of the same opinion .
mr scicluna 's report reflect this approach .
the graviti of the situat ha been accur describ .
a don abbondio europ ' is of no use to u .
but this ha been tri , of cours .
this , too , doe not necessarili have a deficit trigger .
( applaus )
mr presid , let u tri and learn from this situat .
the figur it submit were unclear and unreli .
that is turn the world on it head .
if not , should you not have known that ?
i hope you can give me a straight answer to that question .
it ha been at 30-40 % for year .
noth to do with the crisi at all .
a complet disast .
no , the euro ha not been success at all .
it is alreadi fail .
it is alreadi crumbl befor our eye .
just look at some econom basic .
there is no lender .
far too mani of u .
( ro ) the mafia is the major caus of the crisi .
this is no longer a market economi , but a jungl economi .
starvat is the most power elector factor in histori .
we need a more autom system .
this could be the result of the summit .
they have to export their good .
that is not suffici .
we have enough to do ourselv with the budgetari consolid .
it is import not to underestim the work involv .
this is not a true european polici .
( applaus )
howev , there are other - collect - respons .
we share a common destini , a mr trichet so right said .
the deficit is still extrem larg .
i would like to finish by say someth about specul .
the languag of war doe not suit the style of bank .
onli two are in euroland .
my point of view , therefor , will be differ .
doe this mean we are lazi ?
there is a certain contradict here .
we should avoid such inconsist .
the econom situat in numer countri is clear negat .
unemploy is increas in most countri .
the sign were there .
the necess and desir of set up an emf are dubious .
it is realli up to the council now to make a move .
twenti member state current have excess deficit .
greater econom union may make the differ .
global imbal need to be correct .
the european union is one of the most balanc region .
uncheck , ireland 's deficit wa head toward 14 % of gdp .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
it is true that mani are demand econom govern .
the ecb will have an import role in this area .
the pact 's main aim wa prevent .
thank you .
quit clear , i am sorri to hear this .
this is what we must take into account .
we must take this into account for two reason .
this is the spirit that we have to discov .
this is the magic panacea that we need .
in mani countri , cut in public expenditur are need .
there is still much to do in this regard .
but for how much longer ?
the polit prevar of recent week ha not onli damag greec .
it ha serious shaken confid in the euro .
whi is the presid of the eurogroup not in the g20 ?
this is the price of the euro 's continu success .
some member state behav like child , hide their misde .
you have been compet , independ and consist .
the euro is a stabilis forc , even in time of crisi .
on the contrari , it is part of the solut .
there can be no reform without the euro .
no one ha said that noth could be done .
we must continu on this rout in the interest of the euro .
i would like to draw attent to one aspect of it .
we have had the two-spe europ ' slogan .
my countri , slovakia , is no except to the rule .
unemploy ha risen abov 13 % .
that is true outsid the eurozon a well a insid it .
my parti is plea that the uk remain outsid the eurozon .
howev , keep our own currenc is onli part of the answer .
we are not over the difficult time .
we are not go back to busi a usual .
we have to remain extrem alert .
i fulli agre with that .
this is a key issu .
i want to stress that .
you can trust u .
we can prove that .
this is not theori .
these are fact ; these are figur .
they must draw consequ from this nation .
they benefit from belong to the euro area .
we are a colleg .
the govern council is the pertin entiti .
it is the govern council which count .
i have listen to your view veri care .
bind polici recommend will also be use in this regard .
this is need to prevent an accumul of imbal .
rapporteur . - mr presid , a few point first .
we know we are not yet an optim currenc area .
howev , that is whi we have to be innov .
we have to follow sensibl econom principl and polici .
we know that there are sever option befor u .
look at greec and the stabil programm , which wa prais .
the debat is close .
the vote will take place on thursday , 25 march 2010 .
written statement ( rule 149 )
better coordin would enhanc euro area stabil .
the prevent arm should be strengthen .
the report must therefor be reject .
on the contrari , it will further exacerb them .

explan of vote
the caus of this situat are vari .
this is unaccept .
that is a fact .
their valu and norm are direct at odd with our own .
we can observ similar tendenc in our countri now .
i disagre with that .
the contrari is true .
that explain what is happen in europ today .
all of the member state are look for budget reduct .
there should be a clear divid .
these are the reason whi i vote for this report .
we have done a good job .
we see qualiti logo in a number of area of our life .
it is a matter for nation govern to legisl .
that wa my first point .
i will be veri brief with my second point .
i refer you to the gospel of st matthew , chapter 22 .
i am sure you will rememb this .
our lord is ask whether it is proper to pay tax to rome .
he say : whi tempt ye me , ye hypocrit ?
show me the tribut money ' .
and they brought unto him a penni .
they say unto him : caesar 's ' .
thank heaven we had the foresight to keep the pound .
thank you for bless this morn 's session , mr hannan .
but let u look at some of the thing that we propos .
it is an irrelev report .
you will now collect about usd 6 trillion worth of capit .
no , what did we go and do just now ?
written explan of vote
now , imit product must be clear label .
we green agre with the procedur .
the european union can do a great deal here .
howev , what littl is given may reliev their pain .
in the kingdom of eurocrat , a clear conscienc come cheap .
i abstain from vote on this particular report .
the specif problem is not one of sound ' financ .
a ccctb is not about a common tax rate .
clear , this europ is yet anoth enemi of the peopl .
the verdict express by my vote ha a broader context .
we onli need to carri out that process ration .
mr constâncio ha an impress cv .
we would so veri much like to believ him .
three such import incid are a lot for one man .
these word were echo loud in portug .
that be the case , my abstent is justifi .
it set a serious preced .
this wa no ordinari vote .
the hungarian press produc a document regard this .
they ask for the past not to be reviv .
this is wrong .
the past is not dead .
this would be a recip for the polit of diminish respons .
public offic would lose digniti .
mr fazaka hid his past and lie when ask about it .
this lack of honesti should not be reward .
in view of this , i decid to endors his candidaci .
it oper with complet independ .
in write . - i fulli endors these recommend .
there are mani issu of interest at global level .
it is true that it promot the abolit of capit punish .
for this reason , i abstain dure the final vote .
educ is the key to the integr process .
generic integr ' is not enough .
decis step must be taken to bring an end to discrimin .
for this reason , i have vote against the report .
in recent year , this ha been chang .
this problem is often neglect .
in this draft decis , the council exceed it execut power .
facil such a this should not be set in motion .
the opinion of parliament 's legal servic is veri clear .
the commiss exceed it power of implement .
this is not mere a technic procedur .
invest in young peopl is invest in the futur .
we larg agre with the prioriti state in the report .
howev , this is neither the onli way nor inevit .
this must also be reflect in the budgetari prioriti .
i did , of cours , vote in favour .
today 's vote wa except for two reason .
i am happi with the report 's cautionari aspect .
the treati of lisbon ha given parliament new respons .
in write . - i vote in favour of this import report .
it is there to serv produc and consum .
it will help custom and small busi alik .
it could be particular benefici to our agri-food sector .
therefor , i absolut can not vote for it .
that is whi i vote in favour .
citizen have the right to protect .
for this reason , i have vote in favour of the report .
for this reason , i have vote against this amend .
i vote for the report on the futur of food qualiti polici .
for this reason , we must protect them .
in write . - i fulli support this report .
i call for addit fund to be earmark for develop countri .
it is not enough , howev .
it support cancel the debt of the least develop countri .
he who owe his entir fortun to specul .
this text support the implac logic of liber dogmat .
it is therefor harm .
i vote against .
i vote against this report for sever reason .
tradit develop aid ha larg fail in it purpos .
all these paragraph were adopt by comfort major .
i vote against the ecb report for 2008 .
that is whi we vote against it .
clear , this europ is yet anoth enemi of the peopl .
ha the ecb fulfil it role ?
it is hard to be sure .
we are still wait for the result of these action .

approv of the minut of the previous sit
the minut have been approv .
i think it is onli right that we rememb those victim too .
you are right , mr speroni .
we rememb all victim with great pain .
this is whi i mention it .
howev , you are absolut right , mr speroni .
thank you , mr speroni , for point this out to me .
thank you veri much .
allow me to start with the latter point .
the union 's capac to find a compromis remain intact .
it is fundament to our exist .
the european central bank also agre .
that is whi it creat a task forc under my author .
it will present it conclus befor the end of this year .
the european council will take the final polit decis .
i intend to give a high prioriti to this work .
a strengthen of our mechan is essenti .
this discus is crucial .
budgetari disciplin is not suffici .
behind budgetari problem lie econom problem .
this appli also to econom polici .
it will be the result of our effort , not an instrument .
we ignor it at our peril .
we will pursu intern work a well .
let me assur you that i am neither .
the two come year will be difficult .
that will also be the case for the european parliament .
but let u be frank .
but let u be frank about anoth point a well .
the question wa not whether there would be a respons .
the question wa what the respons could and should be .
it is a prudent safeti net .
this is what we need and this is what we have got .
the commiss is satisfi with the final shape of the mechan .
it may not be perfect .
and it core featur retain the essenti .
the institut keep the role of trigger the mechan .
let me now turn to the discus of the europ 2020 strategi .
the commiss 's view on the matter is also veri clear .
what about child ?
how are you go to treat pension ?
it is about make all level work well and togeth a a whole .
but we have the right springboard .
we have the track record of action insid the eu .
what we now need is to be determin and consist .
this seem promis .
the onli thing that matter to our citizen are the result .
solidar and respons right take centr stage in this plan .
can greec restor confid on the financi market ?
this will be crucial to resolv the crisi .
let u look , primarili , at greec .
that is down to the council .
if you look at the market , you will see that it ha react .
that is not a solut .
the council must find solut .
the situat with europ 2020 is similar .
what doe the council then do to europ 2020 ?
it tear sever part from it .
( applaus )
you will have a second european council in june .
i wish you everi success for that european council .
( applaus )
this did not start yesterday , but a week ago now .
that is not the way to help greec .
we need that now .
we need a courag packag .
onli the european commiss can do this .
( applaus )
that is not a punish for the biggest countri , germani .
the technic mean to do this exist and can be made applic .
the third thing we need is a bolder 2020 strategi .
the rate thus went up immedi after the council 's decis .
if it were a net , it would have to bear weight .
( applaus )
this behaviour , to my mind , is not right .
is she suppos to go empty-hand ?
it is embarrass !
there ha thus been so much negat energi from germani !
i have to say , i wa not one of them .
we do not support all aspect of the initi .
it is no packag to cover the citizen .
i regard that a a dubious procedur .
over 20 % of under-25-year-old are out of work .
otherwis , i fear the worst .
june this year is much too late .
well , what price free speech , what price democraci ?
in fact , all centralis eu plan fail .
just look at the disastr , ruinous common fisheri polici .
what realli matter is the loss of democraci .
you have not been elect .
a far a we are concern this is unfinish busi .
( nl ) mr presid .
this debat is a big sham .
yet what are we see now ?
they have chang their mind ; they have buckl .
appar their word were worth noth .
portug , spain , hungari , you name it .
mr van baalen , whi are you not contradict mr verhofstadt ?
it is your own group that is advoc this .
mr presid , ladi and gentleman , i will be fair brief .
there are some basic truth of which i must remind you .
these must be correct .
step must be taken to prevent them ever occur again .
we ask greec to take some measur .
it ha taken them ; it ha shoulder it respons .
nevertheless , they must be carri out .
it is convinc of that .
i wit their agreement befor , dure and after the meet .
third , they have not yet ask for financi support .
they repeat that again yesterday .
i do not take exampl from the past .
this import task forc must be veri ambiti .
we must draw everi consequ there is to draw from it .
we must be far more prevent .
let u not endang them !
that respons is incumb on the eu .
to each , their own respons .
we must , therefor , also be more prevent in econom term .
we will , therefor , think about all of that .
we will discus them open in the task forc .
there is a tendenc to forget veri quick .
howev , we must continu to work on it .
the g20 work hard at the start of the crisi .
it is necessari to work hard follow a recess .
the crisi is still not quit over , but the recess is over .
we will implement them at nation level .
we will ass the situat .
the task forc is , let u say , the embodi of wisdom .
how can all that be improvis ?
( applaus )
thank you , mr van rompuy .
there were critic remark , which we all heard .
they are necessari in such a discus .
we are talk about a matter of the greatest import .
it is , therefor , a key issu .
on top of this there are matter relat to climat .
the european parliament is fulli readi for this .
we in the eu can onli do so much .
we need to respect the rule we have .
so we know what to do .
what are the instrument , though ?
we have known this for year .
it is a secret coordin method today .
whi be so afraid of growth ?
one thing that is immedi need is energi effici .
we know it creat job and competit .
final , on the role of parliament : consult is not enough .
i wish to ask someth about the eu 2020 strategi .
this appli to u all .
this is not a revolutionari idea , nor wa it my idea .
if not , we shall becom the bruge of the globalis world .
a new orgi of specul , with borrow rate hit histor high .
the plan fail .
this is not the europ of solidar and cohes .
this is what europ need : real subsidiar and real feder .
howev , there is alway talk of new ground rule and solut .
these have been on the tabl for some time alreadi !
that is whi independ is so veri import in polit .
wa he not invit , or is this an error in the minut ?
i want to know your thought .
you are not a spectat ; you said , 'i am a facilit ' .
i spoke for about 15-20 minut on the most import point .
you can read it ; i will send it to you .
what we need today is econom govern .
what that mean , no one yet know .
they have sunk almost without trace in this communiqué .
we have a framework of rule in place .
we are work on implement those , which i am plea about .
the european union should take appropri step here .
in one way , i think that we have taken a step forward .
you have preach the status quo on climat polici .
you have your resit in june .
second , i would like to offer mr reul 's excus .
the criterion when it come to money are clear .
we need more european solut .
my second point concern europ 2020 .
europ 2020 is not an object .
a you know , the greek govern ha deni these rumour .
what ha happen to these intent ?
( hu ) i would like to make two remark .
they promis it will be readi by the end of april .
how could a june adopt be possibl ?
in ani event , the idea seem too general for the moment .
therefor i will speak about the moral crisi .
what ha happen ?
( ga ) i would like him to speak a littl about this crisi .
but who know what battl await europ ?
howev , this is about u and the polit parti we belong to .
presid van rompuy , you spoke about budgetari disciplin .
i thought that wa easi to understand .
when will peopl be told the truth ?
there is consider contradict within the specif of goal .
the commiss need to clarifi the flow of inform with greec .
someon is account and must be made account .
this is an issu which is differ from support greec .
i would like to answer telegraph some of those question .
a lot of member spoke on the issu of greec .
that is exact what we would like to achiev .
there are just a few point that i wish to stress .
mani of you have call for more europ .
the treati of lisbon is veri clear .
it doe not includ so-cal bailout claus .
it did not forese this kind of situat .
therefor , we must find someth .
inde , europ ha contribut a veri larg amount .
he did not , i repeat onc again , request financi assist .
there is a great deal of work to do .
the treati doe not provid for this .
should we discus this within the task forc ?
i believ that that is the top prioriti .
he ha sound the alarm , and right so .
in fact , we face some veri great challeng in three area .
whi not includ the intern market in the five object ?
it is an instrument , but an import one .
some of you have ask , what is the point of all this ? '
it is the veri first time .
mani of the speech consist of comment , not question .
this is a veri import discus for all of u .
written statement ( rule 149 )
the solut propos is everyth but a european one .
with this in mind , we must all make effort .
i am count on good and comprehens cooper in this area .
this is an import step toward strengthen european solidar .
the summit had optimist and promis signific .

the funer of the presid and his wife wa held yesterday .
we need to strike at poverti and unemploy .
there is no longer ani margin for inact .
i would ask the commiss to respond to this appeal .
i would like , today , to mention the problem of eurostat .
the economi can not take prioriti over peopl 's safeti .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
it is our duti to prevent the occurr of social dump .
that is becaus the govern ha interven .
thus , it wa not a point of order .
you gave the floor to a man five time in a row .
thank you veri much .
that conclud this item .
power of legisl deleg ( debat )
from now on , it will be possibl to do so .
i think that we should focus on them .
parliament had veri few right in this process .
we were inform , but we were not colegisl .
the treati of lisbon ha now chang that .
we want to receiv inform a earli a the council receiv it .
that is actual the key point in this regard .
thank you , mr szájer .
we will need to remind ourselv of this again and again .
onc again , this ha a lot to do with transpar .
on that note , i would say keep up the good work .
in fact , articl 290 refer precis to this matter .
this wa underlin by the rapporteur , mr szájer .
the debat is close .
written statement ( rule 149 )
air safeti : eu airlin blacklist ( debat )
how we can now build on this is the question face u today .
we must build on and learn from the experi we have gain .
there are some area where further action is necessari .
first of all , in the area of communic with passeng .
we need to think that one through .
do we realli have a watertight system ?
we have seen some exampl of that .
we will soon be discus how we can remedi this situat .
of cours , this doe not need to influenc safeti .
this is about aviat safeti for european passeng .
i have tri this out for myself .
so here we have a problem then .
the european parliament is speak on this matter yet again .
this show what import we attach to the matter .
i spoke about this a coupl of month ago .
after everyth that ha been said , i have a person reflect .
this is a complet schizophren situat .
further develop is also import for u .
the general comment is a follow .
what is happen here to inform peopl who need to fli ?
i will leav it at that one question .
we also work veri much with icao .
i will mention an exampl from indonesia that wa ask of me .
the debat is close .
this is unaccept .
mani thank for bring this to our attent .
we will look into this accord and see what happen .
written statement ( rule 149 )
aviat secur charg ( debat )
no one realli doe it proper .
howev , we will have to pay for this .
what specif will it chang , and what doe it aim to chang ?
there are state which have financ them pure through taxat .
our intent wa to ensur that these system could be retain .
i think that they are all veri justifi and well-found .
thank you veri much for this excel report .
i wa target a moment ago .
this is typic if you live in austria .
the far-right winger sit over there .
i would like half a minut to ask a question .
mani thank .
we will now continu with the debat .
howev , the council ha alway obstruct this .
obvious , we need to bear in mind a few consider .
the first and the most essenti one is transpar .
she can not be here today .
we do not want to impos anyth .
this is not alway provid at the moment .
of cours , the state do not want to pay for it .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
that also appli to charg .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
this is quit an import consider in my view .
therefor , this dossier also ha an econom aspect .
we are now talk about around 30 % of the cost .
therefor , these three point are crucial for me .
airport secur is the respons of member state .
this mean that various item can be confisc .
thank you for your attent .
i would like to quick rais anoth point .
howev , these measur must be transpar .
what , in the end , is the issu here ?
we should therefor not start too high .
madam presid , mr leichtfri is right .
that simpli should stop .
transpar is imper here .
the report and the commiss propos strengthen each other .
we will see where that debat lead .
we have work hard on this matter for near a year now .
from the start , we have been veri will to compromis .
this is not onli my opinion .
we now have the treati of lisbon .
the debat is close .
written statement ( rule 149 )
this is the reason for our amend , therefor .
it is our respons to give our citizen good , clear inform .
thank you .
( de ) madam presid , yes , i rather prefer non-attach ' .
moreov , the financ ha still not been clarifi .
that is not all , howev .
road are the arteri of our economi .
that is someth on which we all agre .
howev , we must not simpli take a just-in-tim ' approach .
this will be particular import in futur .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
it doe not fit into the european landscap .
that can not be allow to happen !
it then sudden disappear again - and no one know whi .
that is whi it must no longer be includ in these guidelin .
that is his respons .
that is someth that we should all take note of .
we must get rid of this transrapid system .
we will manag , nevertheless .
that is certain fulfil with this report .
howev , that is the wrong way to go about it .
i feel that particular attent must be focus on corridor 7 .
it could provid europ with a proper transport backbon .
these traffic corridor are found all over europ .
the debat is close .
the first key point is the import of the sector .
the first challeng is the need to increas competit .
it is a fact that free competit is the life blood of ship .
we therefor need a dynam polici .
let me briefli address three point .
there are numer other point that i could mention here .
mr van dalen , congratul on this excel report .
we also highlight protect against piraci .
in particular , it is a use tool against global warm .
we will therefor be retabl our amend to plenari .
this is posit , but the fight ha yet to realli begin .
i also support the requir for shipbuild and steel qualiti .
i have a coupl of comment , howev .
risk-bas control alon are not suffici .
the problem is far greater in the water around indonesia .
that also affect eu ship compani .
this situat must be end .
i am refer to the situat in the horn of africa .
in other word , we must counteract the risk of deflag .
there are three import area for consider .
first of all , employ and work condit .
these are the thing we need to build on .
final , it goe without say that safeti is essenti .
that ha becom abund clear .
we all know how import this area is .
we need new blood .
the environment aspect ha alreadi been mention .
in individu case , we may also need state aid for this .
by the summer , we could come out with this .
i should like to refer to three specif question .
one concern state aid guidelin for port .
i can not give ani precis timelin but we are work on it .
it wa realli veri help for the commiss .
first of all , the environ , which is crucial .
such a concept is a reward for good environment behaviour .
i strong endors such a system .
that is necessari .
mr ţicău mention the pari memorandum of understand .
that is , ship have to behav well .
it is a good mission and ha alreadi prove a success .
such cooper seem ideal to me .
the debat is close .
written statement ( rule 149 )
the safeti of the maritim sector is veri import .
europeana - the next step ( short present )
what doe europeana mean ?
it ha 150 partner organis .
it must be a joint european project .
mani peopl still do not know about this .
that is the huge task that we now have to face togeth .
i would like to mention three key factor .
i would like to thank mr trüpel for an excel report .
howev , europeana is not such an entiti .
we welcom it .
again , this is just a start and let u go for it .
more can be done and more need to be done .
the sooner the better .
the site will be further develop in the year thereaft .
it is anyhow worthwhil to fight for it .
the debat is close .
written statement ( rule 149 )
thank you for your attent .
this is import for two reason .
i thought this would cost thousand .
mani countri have compli with the direct .
i am not sure that one can do that .
( fr ) mr presid , mr paulsen , thank you for your report .
this issu reson differ in the various european countri .
not all produc or consum perceiv the issu in the same way .
at the moment , there are shortcom in both of these area .
the question of transport anim ha been rais here .
the action plan , adopt in 2006 , ha basic been a success .
the rule adopt should be implement .
our futur strategi will have to make that clear .
the debat is close .
written statement ( rule 149 )
anim welfar is an import issu .
eu agricultur and climat chang ( short present )
i believ we need to chang direct .
the 2013 cap need to be ambiti .
farmer can not manag this alon .
europ must be self-suffici .
there need to be a reduct here , too .
that it someth that we need to consid in futur .
i am think of benefici effect a well a advers one .
mr presid , i just want to mention my home .
we have a polici that limit greenhous gas emiss .
the debat is close .
written statement ( rule 149 )
climat chang ha a direct influenc on agricultur .
we ought to look at this again .
we therefor need to move forward and move forward quick .
i would like to address a coupl of issu .
the debat is close .
written statement ( rule 149 )
simplif of the cap ( short present )
it is clear that the agricultur industri need to chang .
but what i have develop is two main theme .
it also need to be easier to interpret .
the common agricultur polici need to be simpler .
that must be possibl and we must endeavour to achiev it .
this , howev , is onli a mean , not an end .
the goal is to fulfil all the task of the sector polici .
a radic chang in perspect is need .
in hungari , this is not yet possibl .
it is , inde , wonder .
take a an exampl traceabl .
the debat is close .
written statement ( rule 149 )
the new system must be base on object and fair criterion .
agenda of the next sit : see minut
closur of the sit
open of the sit
they are addit chang .
in this way , the sit on wednesday will close at 19.00 .
the european parliament servic will be here .
there will not be a plenari sit .
the rest will go ahead a normal on thursday .
quit a number of matter were decid .
disrupt of air traffic in europ ( debat )
these concern longer-term answer to the present crisi .
it may be that we will respond with a resolut .
i am talk about differ way of react .
despit that , we have act and react .
safeti ha therefor been maintain a the prioriti .
we want to be involv in this .
we are readi for this .
we are open to this .
that is whi we are have this discus .
the second import point is that safeti come first .
there can not be ani compromis on safeti .
this is , and remain , our fundament concern .
this start this morn at 08.00 , through eurocontrol .
the model for resum flight is the most import thing .
the rule are good one .
everyon share the view that the rule are good .
there is noth wrong with that model .
we can now think about how to modifi the model .
we start discus this yesterday .
this wa , and is , an extraordinari event .
we were veri happi that eurocontrol wa cooper .
we must also , of cours , ass the consequ and outcom .
that wa the key issu address yesterday .
safeti is paramount .
let there be no misunderstand about that .
but what happen in the day follow this ?
we have to take decis action .
in addit , we need structur measur .
airlin have suffer huge econom damag .
that is what i call on you to ensur .
i hope that it will be possibl to get them home quick .
it is import that we now acknowledg this fact onc again .
to a certain extent , we have been taught a lesson .
mani of the citizen of europ were annoy about this .
the posit of the airlin is also understand .
we must protect their right .
on this occas , natur itself play the decis role .
we must take a lesson from this for the futur .
the human race is not omnipot and never will be .
either the airspac is safe or it is not .
these polici have focus entir on air transport .
the volcan erupt in iceland should be a warn to all of u .
too much money and too mani job are at stake .
what doe at their own risk ' actual mean in this case ?
we will be talk later about employ in the european union .
both plane narrowli escap disast .
human life is priceless .
we are all high awar of the serious financi consequ .
howev , a human life is worth much more than good .
this coordin ha work except well .
in my opinion , the top prioriti is the safeti of passeng .
the individu countri made the right decis .
for this reason , we must be extrem cautious .
aid is need , but not onli at a nation level .
justifi , we have discus this subject often in parliament .
for me , the futur lie in the singl european sky .
we need to give our attent to that .
that is anoth model .
that is simpli not possibl .
well , give europ those power , at long last !
that would make thing a lot simpler .
my second point concern scientif inform .
this volcano ha not finish erupt yet .
so , we need to make prepar for the year to come .
i find that extraordinari .
there is no pocket-book precaut .
safeti and the common good are the prioriti .
( da ) mr presid , i have two import point to make .
the outcom will be decid by the debat in the day ahead .
it is good to hear that there is now a three-step plan .
i am plea about that .
aircraft are high energy-intens and pollut .
the cost to airlin goe beyond their lost revenu .
i would like to rais two issu .
the first is relat to state aid .
is state aid through nation budget the best solut ?
are ani other option be consid by the european commiss ?
howev , the situat on the railway remain appal .
this is not accept .
we need a certain amount of reserv .
we must also put more emphasi on accommod .
they also need to have immedi effect that everyon can see .
at least , that is the way the public perceiv it .
this ha been a disast for all concern .
that is not right , either .
passeng safeti must be our overrid concern .
we must deal with this from the centr .
( the presid cut off the speaker )

commiss legisl and work programm for 2010 ( debat )
presid barroso , thank you for come .
it ha not been easi for ani of u to get to strasbourg .

this programm is the direct outcom of our polit dialogu .
we need a perman mechan for resolv crise .
we need to improv intern mechan .
this is where europ can make the differ .
action now will pay dividend in the futur .
thank you veri much for this .
we sent the detail to you even befor accept .
this wa the case in hungari , this wa the case in greec .
the commiss ought to exercis it compet in this regard .
do not misunderstand me .
i am not say that the commiss is to blame for these crise .
now let u move on to what the commiss should do .
it should place citizen at the centr of our work .
job , job , job must be our guid principl .
i find that veri sad .
it goe without say that we must consolid our budget .
my next point relat to the budgetari consolid .
we need more invest .
we discus this earlier on this morn with mr kalla .
we can not toler this .
mr barroso , you refer to the monti report .
you have agre to submit propos for a framework direct .
i would now like to come to my final and decis point .
this is not accept .
of cours , govern must have a certain freedom .
this is whi the commiss must have a power voic .
howev , we must both fight for a strong europ .
i can not see ani such project in this programm today .
i also believ that we need far-reach project .
we urgent need budgetari , econom and industri coordin .
i am think in particular of the issu of corpor taxat .
we will have to work on this .
even the introduct ha the titl 'a new era ' .
this mean that we are face major challeng .
we also support energi taxat .
the group in parliament have also ask you about this .
mr hedegaard 's peopl have not yet decid .
i hope that they will set more ambiti object .
there is still a lot to do .
that approach wa wrong and it fail .
this must be the overrid prioriti defin the commiss .
the commiss must be their alli , not their adversari .
we do not , of cours , like everyth .
whi , though , is it time to act ?
i will give you an exampl .
is that anoth joke ?
our disagr with you is about polici .
that is a recip for more unemploy .
when will we have the european credit rate agenc ?
ask the european public .
howev , my messag is also for europhil .
howev , we must examin whi the problem occur .
europ is slowli but steadili be ethnic clean of european .
we need greater ambit in europ .
i am in favour of subsidiar .
subsidiar mean decid which level of decis make is best .
that is unbeliev !
the decis wa taken by each european nation regul .
it is all realli rather extraordinari .
( applaus )
let u be clear .
let u show some common sen !
( applaus )
thank you veri much , mr barroso , for your statement .
the commiss ha work veri hard .
it is also grate to the european parliament .
the debat is close .
written statement ( rule 149 )
it is right that europ must respond joint to the crisi .
nevertheless , no one want to chang anyth .
we need to be lay the foundat for this now .
unfortun , these concern main the econom situat .
they have to be given at the meet of the council in june .
this must be a process , and not election .
onli then will the result of referendum not be a surpris .
most of them were complet deplet after the earthquak .
i will give you two specif exampl .
that , of cours , lead to work on reconstruct .
last but not least , we are veri focus on result .
the new york confer took place in a veri good spirit .
i will also inaugur a school in mirabelai .
deliv budget support is not blind support .
two aspect stand out , in particular .
there are three point i want to rais .
the world bank ha done excel work on this .
the third point i want to make is this .
again , i thank both commission for their present .
delay the reconstruct effort would be equal irrespons .
it wa truli heartbreak .
keep work toward that goal .
i wish you everi success and , abov all , god 's help .
the critic period is probabl still not over .
what should be done , then ?
so , congratul !
we need to creat fix fund mechan .
european resourc need to be use effici .
obvious , an earthquak caus the disast in haiti .
this will be a long process , in my view .
you have confirm that yourselv .
the third stage is someth onli for u .
it is possibl .
it can be set up quick befor the next disast .
i call on you now to stop talk about coordin and to act .
not mani countri provid rapid and effect aid .
not even the experi of sever rescu group wa suffici .
we need to stick to the pledg we are make now .
this ha been veri use and veri encourag for u .
let me turn to four question that have been pose .
this is someth we are watch veri close .
i want to address the issu of shelter .
they do not want to move for a varieti of reason .
but we are address this a a prioriti .
let me finish with the question of long-term sustain .
it is govern sustain , it is also ecolog sustain .
we are think in the long term when we think of chile .
we are definit not creat anyth parallel .
we are work on the same base and on well-prepar ground .
we are work on properti right .
that is one of the risk element .
the debat is close .
( the sit wa suspend at 13.10 and resum at 15.05 )
written statement ( rule 149 )
doe the aid support sustain develop in haiti ?
how wa the entir aid effort coordin ?

it is not .
it is a coordin of loan .
the commiss will have this respons .
therefor , i will repeat it .
my question is slight differ .
i am not here to repli on behalf of mr merkel .
i am here to repli on behalf of the commiss .
let u be clear about that .
let u also be clear from the point of view of the commiss .
natur , we have been veri cautious on that point .
you could at least say so public .
i would like to ask anoth question about acta .
parliament is everi bit a import a a larg compani .
we shall do it .
i also want to hear the social partner ' view .
this is a veri difficult issu and an extrem sensit one .
that is what we are go to do .
i have one question .
do you think that we and the commiss have done enough ?
i think the commiss propos were the right one .
for instanc , i am support the idea of a bank levi .
i think that should be a matter for the g20 .
so , a alway , it is a question of balanc .
mr barroso , i have anoth brief question .
he is not chang anyth .
he ha said that he want to make return of 25 % onc again .
presid of the commiss . - absolut not .
let u be honest and open about it .
we need a proper level of regul .
on the contrari : it aim at build trust .
that is my question .
i apologis for that word .
would you agre ?
presid of the commiss . - i do not agre .
we are not there .
it should be kept , of cours , in the communiti method .
the cost of the finish product from china is eur 5.50 .
that will be self-def for u .

i had a great respect for presid kaczyński .
i work in a veri loyal manner with him .
i did everyth to be present at his funer .
it wa no longer possibl for me to go .
we discus this in the colleg meet today .
without growth , we can not generat employ .
it happen and now we have to react to it consequ .
the other 99 % is in the hand of the member state .
we have to discus afterward the financi perspect .
this is our intent .
this is just one of mani exampl of job be lost in europ .
in my view , this is not specif enough .
you should provid exampl .
that is the onli way to do it .
a you have said , 20 % of young peopl are unemploy .
this would therefor requir a larg amount of labour migrat .
in my opinion , there is someth of a contradict here .
what is the european strategi on this issu ?
can we not bring about such a strategi ?
our societi will alway pay a big price for exclus .
there is a lot to do in this area .
they have not done so .

this is now a matter of the utmost urgenc .
we must provid long-term assist in this area .
crimin group oper freeli in the countri .
the situat is complet unclear for the local peopl .

it is extrem import to prevent this from happen .
this is the reason for the long debat .
what could the problem be here ?
we want answer to these question .
let me give an exampl .
we will return to these in next year 's report .
there were improv in 2009 in this regard .
how can this be prevent ?
incident , i am plea that the council is still here .
i shall have anoth opportun to do that later .
i should like to rais a few issu .
the first concern the commiss 's discharg .
are you prepar to take up this option ?
yet this is no problem , ladi and gentleman .
i commend the commiss for the improv they have made .
this is most encourag .
howev , a great deal need to be done .
one exampl is the commiss 's account .
is this accept ?
we know all the excus .
the blame is pas from pillar to post .
such pressur must also be exert on the council .
let me give a specif exampl .
we must therefor ask the council the obvious question .
which countri are benefit from it ?
the council is happi to answer inform , off the record .
that is simpli not good enough .
our critic of the council and the commiss is clear .
the rest is affect by differ level of error .
of cours not .
we should be make the decis on discharg in view of this .
can taxpay toler this game anymor ?
this is about their money .
we shall see .
he ha just the same freedom to speak a you do .
5 ) a reduct in the member of the administr board .
11 ) the principl of subsidiar .
so , the solut are on the tabl .
i wa not formal invit by parliament to attend this debat .
that is what mr gerbrandi said .
thank you minist .
thank you veri much for so kind compli with our request .
the fact is , we do not have a clue .
i have read and reread that statement .
i also propos shorten the deadlin .
the deadlin have to be shorten .
i propos a studi on the consolid account .
we share his critic and that of the other group .
howev , our critic , i agre , ha no real consequ .
a mr audi ha point out , we must develop our tool .
that will possibl also mean constitut chang .
thank you veri much , mr weiler .
mani happi return !
( de ) thank you , mr presid , that wa veri kind .
howev , i see light and shadow in the report .
i see light in budgetari manag overal .
whether or not it is effici is anoth matter altogeth .
there is shadow in the area of cohes polici .
we want 100 % of the money back .
we must and will examin this veri close .
this is not accept and we must deal with it .
we must ensur transpar , here and in the council .
in addit , a broader mandat is requir .
first , there is often the problem of budget support .
i am extrem critic of this budget support .
( applaus )
self-critic is good , but it should then be accur .
there are propos that are alreadi a realiti .
we could re-tabl them , but whi ?
noth should be more obvious .
our motto should be not to wast a singl cent .
unfortun , that is not current the case .
allow me to give a veri clear exampl : eu aid to eritrea .
they have languish in appal prison condit for year .
what have they done ?
they have criticis the countri 's leadership and presid .
we should be clearer about this .
this titl is veri apt .
there are obvious still shortcom .
these were mention by parliament and the court of auditor .
the caus of these shortcom are both object and subject .
i will boil them down to three measur .
yet here we are talk about eur 4.8 million up to 2013 .
at first , a sen of helpless predomin in the committe .
here , we have the begin of a compromis .
that is , after all , one and the same topic .
that is a good thing .
that is , of cours , a good thing .
have said that , there is still room for improv .
instead , we should ensur that we have onli one seat .
i have everi confid in this happen .
our court of auditor is current unabl to do this .
my second request regard budgetari control .
fund were not spent effect and were not suffici evalu .
now to the differ agenc in general .
this also includ the new european asylum support offic .
i would like to reject that suspicion .
mr søndergaard wa veri concern about this .
i think that this will give u result in the futur .
this is an import messag to convey to citizen of the eu .
we all know what that mean .
decid that at this point is the wrong way to go .
the third time it ha been harder .
that is my basic posit .
i will remind everyon that a year ago , it wa the same .
the council wa grant discharg onli in novemb .
i think i propos such an oral amend at the vote in may .
we need to think veri serious about this , mr presid .
the debat is close .
the vote will take place dure the may part-sess .
written statement ( rule 149 )
we can not be hard enough on ourselv in this regard .
wherev there are peopl work togeth , thing will go wrong .
even the strictest intern control can not prevent that .
i should like to give two exampl .
the abus that exist have now been virtual elimin .
the second exampl is the reimburs of expens .
ha this solv all the problem ?
absolut not .
( the sit wa suspend at 12.00 and resum at 15.00 )
approv of the minut of the previous sit : see minut
swift ( debat )
that , moreov , is precis what european legisl permit .
i think the mandat is ambiti but realist .
data will be process onli for the purpos of terror .
a request must be base on judici authoris .
third parti will not get bulk data .
there will be reciproc .
but we also need to be realist here .
reciproc is part of the mandat .
it is not part of the negoti .
this is what we shall be discus today in this chamber .
after the vote in februari , two clear lesson were learnt .
what exact do we , here in europ , want for ourselv ?
it need to be face .
we are keen to do that in a construct manner .
qualiti must come befor timefram .
i would like to make one other preliminari remark .
i do not think we can treat our own decis like that .
the problem of bulk data transfer remain unresolv .
the mandat doe not offer a solut here either .
we need an ambiti mandat with our demand .
how can that work ?
in the unit state ?
or are there other propos ?
now , my question is , what doe that mean ?
plea enlighten me here .
it mark a huge departur from eu legisl and practic .
reason suspicion can not be enough .
a mr sippel said , qualiti must take preced over quantiti .
these are the matter we need to negoti on now .
i therefor invit you to come on board .
i think it is import to state this , befor go ani further .
mr presid , clear , the commiss ha listen .
i want to say someth on process and someth on context .
i think such polit will should be present here .
it is claim that there are technic problem inher in this .
this tenet must be amend .
the fight against terror is our prioriti .
we need veri good reason if we are to say yes ' this time .
the principl of proport and effect are paramount .
also , will the unit state realli do the same for u ?
i should like to hear your respons .
( de ) mr presid , thank you , commission malmström .
the european commiss is not veri flexibl in this area .
the focus should onli be on terror .
i am plea to hear that the commiss agre with this .
it is imper that we have the most appropri safeguard .
howev , what can we ask for in return ?
the current plan are disproportion in my view .
that is whi sever question need to be ask .
the previous agreement stipul a maximum period of 90 year .
it is up to parliament to make this one of it prerog .
anti-american is not a common caus in europ .
let u trust our u partner .
therefor we are in favour of the transfer of specif data .
unfortun , the council presid wa conspicu by it absenc .
there is , of cours , an intermedi posit .
target is view with distast and condemn a discriminatori .
i would call it common sen .
is there a time limit to this bilater agreement ?
we can not do this by trampl on human right , howev .
if this happen , then we will have help the terrorist .
it is our credibl that is at stake here .
i am grate that she ha said so public .
it is not about that .
the retent period for data ha also been mention .
in addit , there will be absolut reciproc .
there will be an eu review team .
the eu review team will also have access to this inform .
the whole deal is onli for terror purpos .
the rest will remain anonym .
the american have shown a veri open attitud so far .
that is a veri import discus .
it need to be explor in depth within europ .
of cours , that will not be part of the negoti .
so this is a parallel discus .
we will communic that to the minist .
i said earlier that the american are will .
it will be a difficult negoti and we need the time .
so plea be understand about this .
the debat is close .
the vote will take place dure the first part-sess in may .
written statement ( rule 149 )
passeng name record ( pnr ) ( debat )
i would like to highlight three item in it .
these , i believ , are three import principl .
i think that is a wise strategi .
i am look forward to work further with you on these issu .
that is quit clear .
there are still signific object to this agreement .
i will go into the detail onc more short .
pnr cover 19 individu piec of data .
that is a crucial question .
origin , it wa alway said that it wa about combat terror .
now howev , it is also about serious crime .
this can be discus .
howev , we must go into great detail here .
offici , we still do not have these result yet .
that wa in februari .
it is veri import to creat a uniform agreement .
the issu of data must be review again .
this is realli the key to everyth .
if not , then i would recommend that you watch it .
a seem infal system that final provid secur .
i would not like our debat to be a debat about cinema .
this can be a matter of life and death for these peopl .
( mt ) i would like to make three brief comment .
this is someth that we would do well to emphasis .
second , is this agreement import or not ?
in my opinion , it is veri import inde .
just about everyon will travel by air sooner or later .
someth need to be done about this .
we need disclosur regul like the usa 's privaci act .
these must be open to european citizen .
the way to legal action must likewis stand open to them .
that happen last year befor christma .
i believ that we alreadi know who pose a threat .
i hope now that we will soon be abl to fli safe again .
i have no quarrel with that .
therefor , a definit of the term serious crime ' is vital .
clear correct of data must be possibl .
i think the debat we had on swift may clarifi matter .
last , my third comment is connect with the previous one .
i think that is a fals dilemma .
hope , we will have good result .
i have listen care to the debat .
i have read your resolut .
i think it is a veri balanc and wise resolut .
the debat is close .
the vote will take place dure the first part-sess in may .
ban on use of cyanid mine technolog ( debat )
is this a worthi goal ?
yes , it is .
clear it is .
unfortun , there are .
this repres a serious threat to our environ .
yet this is the result of this obsolet technolog .
let u not wait for a new catastroph to warn u of this .
this is whi resourc effici is a prioriti for this commiss .
not all use these danger cyanid technolog .
there are numer problem surround the invest .
a great deal of poison will be releas into the environ .
there are also similar plan in other countri .
hungari report 1 367 tonn of dead fish .
technolog which use cyanid are hazard .
the resolut mention 30 accid over the last 25 year .
the resolut onli discus mine and , specif , gold product .
finland is a big gold produc by european standard .
technolog is also signific there .
i believ we need this chang in attitud throughout europ .
i therefor realli must ask for a long-term approach here .
howev , their caus were similar : tail pond which collaps .
howev , a we have heard , it is high danger .
the goal is to make a differ worldwid with technic innov .
here , there is high technolog , i know .
i see great potenti for trade in this .
my own countri wa among those affect .
everi countri in the world must do the same .
the subject befor u is a veri curious matter .
it reignit an accid that took place 10 year ago .
whi ha there been this long silenc ?
and whi now ?
whi a debat now ?
i find the whole matter unjustifi .
i know it realli well .
that wa a translat error .
i am familiar with the geographi of central europ .
we share your concern about cyanid .
thank you for this debat .
the commiss is take this veri serious .
the debat is close .
the vote will take place dure the may i part-sess .
i wish you a safe journey to your home .

all other countri provid 5 % or le each .
an increas contribut by the member state is desir .
onli then can we talk about more financi resourc .

correct to vote and vote intent : see minut
statement by the presid
the next item is the joint debat on the follow :
der sommer war sehr groß ... ' .
we call that the communiti method .
i will begin with the call of an intergovernment confer .
consequ , mr presid , there is no debat .
we therefor support what ha alreadi been said .
first , we are revis the treati .
this is no light matter .
that is all this is about , but it is an import question .
parliament respond that there is no need .
there is no need on this occas .
this is what we are deal with , but there is a problem .
it is the citizen who do the elect .
in 11 out of 12 countri that is what ha happen .
howev , at this point the treati is at risk of collaps .
we should be prudent with public money at all time .
i think this is a veri bad develop .
i also think it is a veri unfortun develop .
it is , of cours , contrari to the treati .
we would therefor have to revis the treati .
there is someth rather strang about this .
( fr ) mr presid , i shall come straight to the point .
it is not at all imposs to stick to the elect .
i see no need to conven a convent .
it is a matter of detail that need to be clarifi .
the ball is therefor back in the council 's court .
that would set a preced and i am not happi to accept that .
i urg this hous to oppos this propos .
madam presid , i strong disagre with the previous speaker .
let me thank íñigo and the coordin for take the decis .
it wa not easi .
we should not take so much time on administr matter .
this way we can do our job more effici .
i would like to thank him for this .
therefor , this revis of protocol ( no 36 ) is worthwhil .
that wa a mandat that alreadi exist in the treati of rome .
the debat is close .
the vote will take place on thursday 6 may 2010 at 11.00 .
written statement ( rule 149 )
i am refer to the human element .
we must not forc them to wait ani longer .
clear step forward have been taken .
we need qualiti in public financ .
this view is share by other who matter .
regrett , not all market player seem convinc alreadi .
we have to say loud and clear that the doubter are wrong .
i will come back to this in a moment .
there are three main build block to be consid .
second , interdepend : we are all in this togeth .
we are all compet on world market .
i also believ we need to look at the other caus of imbal .
after all , it is better to be safe than sorri .
we can not have a standstil .
psycholog also matter in market .
that is what we must urgent correct .
we need respons behaviour from all our market player .
i count on this hous to make this clear to all .
this work must be speed up .
we have high hope that the impass in greec will be broken .
i do not think so .
will this argument be heard by the council ?
will we be abl to ensur that it is heard loud and clear ?
will this argument be taken up by the commiss ?
ladi and gentleman , i am not an idealist .
european solidar appli to everi one of the 27 countri .
what will becom of our euro ?
what will we be abl to do for our european citizen ?
thank you for your attent .
i have , here , barri madlen a a speaker .
i will give you the floor in a few minut .
i promis you will be abl to speak .
we can not continu to simpli play a monitor role .
we must learn to build and grow strong togeth .
third , we must develop a new concept of european solidar .
the futur of our contin is at stake .
this is therefor far more serious and more widespread .
we have no other instrument .
becaus this is an intergovernment system !
it is clear that we have been drift for four month .
it is clear that we have made mistak .
they should say : we are to blame ! it is u !
that is my first point .
how much time doe franc need to reform pension ?
how much time doe germani need to build up pension ?
you are complet crazi .
the event current take place in greec prove it .
no one identifi with the state in greec .
what must be creat , howev , is cohes .
it must be creat , it can not be decre !
that is unaccept !
besid , europ can take initi .
the treati must be amend .
we can do it ; yes , we can .
let u do it .
there are employ problem , there are employe .
let them disarm .
i will say one thing : peopl are , nonetheless , hypocrit .
that come to almost eur 3 billion .
they come to eur 1 billion .
yet this is complet hypocrit .
we are give them money to buy our weapon .
let there be some transpar at least .
let u know !
germani ha 200 000 .
let u put that to greec .
this is my request to the commiss : be a littl fairer .
( applaus )
the question and the concern are both legitim .
a eur 110 billion packag is an enorm amount of money .
who would not want that ?
we are now see strike , rebellion , riot and so on .
this ha been absent in recent year .
sudden we have a weak euro and a low growth rate .
howev , the so-cal rescu oper also ha some absurd element .
who will now pay the price for the polit error ?
the worker , ordinari citizen ?
bank are not be place under ani oblig .
onc again , depend worker are to have to accept pay cut .
i believ that is right .
propos for what could be done are on the tabl .
of cours , greec must also do it homework .
mr cohn-bendit ha alreadi spoken veri convinc about this .
what i can not understand is the violenc .
we must call for an end to the violenc .
mr presid , thank you veri much .
these are danger time .
greec is one of them ; it is the tip of the iceberg .
they say solidar is need .
you should be thorough asham .
immigr ha run riot whilst you have look on and done noth .
( el ) mr presid , thank you .
there is absolut no excus for this .
these peopl were kill by murder , by crimin .
worker held a massiv peac ralli in athen today .
they did not kill anyon .
i would not like to get involv in a discus about this .
it is a huge respons .
written statement ( rule 149 )
we are experienc a serious situat .
this decis must be chang at the next summit .
second , we have the main target , which i refer to befor .
let me touch briefli on most of them .
anoth object will be drive on with financi market reform .
we should strive for a coordin and strong approach .
it is go to be an extrem difficult debat .
we have had sever occas to debat them in this hous .
this is clear necessari in order to avoid futur crise .
europ 2020 must be a balanc programm .
they reflect the prioriti of the europ 2020 strategi .
i think this is progress .
this realli can not continu .
parliament will challeng you to do so if need be .
you can count on our support .
it is to be welcom that the council ha set up a task forc .
there is no time to lose .
doe that link realli mean anyth in practic ?
is that chang , though , mr barroso ?
we also have to look at where we want to go .
we can not ignor it .
if they are not clear link , we will go nowher .
this is not about greec , or about ani other member state .
this is not our vision of the futur .
this is not the time .
we need real action , and we need it now .
let me make a comparison .
that is the comparison we have to make .
let me take some exampl .
we negoti the econom recoveri plan .
most of it is not enforc .
we have decid on a set plan , new energi technolog .
the exist legisl must be step up becaus it is not suffici .
the council ha to be bolder and stop bicker .
they have grit their teeth and accept it .
now they are pay the price .
public financ are alreadi overburden by these measur .
for me , climat is the second major issu .
mr ek mention some specif area .
there is a great deal of work to be done on this programm .
mr barroso ha to manoeuvr art between these proposit .
i am not , of cours , a free-market fanat .
there is also no doubt that we must help greec .
we must , therefor , show our solidar with greec today .
i feel he would have learn so much from me this even !
the eu is alreadi crumbl .
that is a rather low level from him .
that is the best european good govern we can have .
we see the situat in the world .
howev , crise can spread .
it is a danger time for all countri .
few countri can count on remain safe .
it is import to keep demand high and to stimul invest .
my third point relat to the financi market .
we need to , but we do not have the courag .
what do you say in europ then ?
the commiss is yet to provid an answer in this regard .
some peopl say that they do not like the definit .
we need to link green invest to new job .
it is far more import than that , colleagu .
let u see some fundament chang in here , both parti .
it is hard mention in this document .
it is time to prioritis social sustain .
mani mistak and one defend in the dock : the euro .
that is true .
we therefor also need a strategi for action .
that is precis what happen .
that is not a critic , either .
the standard can not be the crisi !
the standard must be a forward-look perspect .
howev , we will not actual do it , of cours .
this is the aim of the europ 2020 strategi .
in 10 year ' time will we be more or le unit ?
will we be more support ?
when i heard mr bloom , i wa realli upset .
first of all : choos democraci .
second : work ha to be paid work .
how doe the council actual defin employ ?
third : choos sound public spend .
fourth : choos a social intern market .
fifth : choos poverti reduct .
i see no other way to protect our job , our social system .
what we need is pragmat , courag and decentralis .
( el ) mr presid , thank you veri much .
( applaus )
the strategi 's object must be realist .
is this the europ we want for 2020 ?
we have to break the dictatorship of the market .
it wa not better , howev .
strategi came and went , and the economi collaps .
whi is this ?
europ 2020 is not our goal .
we should give our full support to mr rehn 's measur .
that is what we need , no more and no le .
and we are still in the same posit .
i also fail to see a tangibl desir to identifi prioriti .
we therefor need to make it more specif .
that ha been complet lost .
the biodivers strategi ha fail .
climat protect ha certain been toss about mani time .
this is still too vagu - we need to make it legal bind .
we need capit invest on an unpreced scale .
unemploy is constant rise .
then they will see the differ .
it is simpli a question of carri out this plan .
that is a sensibl thing to do .
it is all about this debat .
mani fellow member have alreadi gone into the detail .
i would like to limit myself to these general statement .
invest in the transport infrastructur are crucial .
our educ system are differ .
without intern cohes there can be no extern competit .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
2020 is base on 2010 .
the object of le poverti is base on today .
think about it and act now .
( de ) thank you veri much mr presid .
he will now miss one of the most import measur .
we have seen problem in greec .
today , 30 % of european do not have vocat qualif .
we are talk about sustain in the environment sen .
there is no question of sustain .
we are talk about sustain in the social sen .
this is complet contrari to sustain in the social sen .
other have also refer to it .
whi did the lisbon strategi fail ?
this wa the direct question ask by mr bokro .
that step ha not been taken .
that is not all .
this phase is that of globalis , which is econom union .
he did express his condol on behalf of the commiss .
it wa the respons and right thing to do .
it is high time to fill the 'e ' with life .
the main build block of our propos are threefold .
second , we must go beyond budgetari surveil .
the third build block will be a crisis-resolut mechan .
in conclus , i count on your support .
that is what our citizen are expect from u .
the debat is close .
the vote will take place dure the second part-sess in may .
( the sit wa suspend for five minut due to technic issu )
written statement ( rule 149 )
innov at compani level requir appropri human resourc .
a top-down and bottom-up approach have to meet each other .
this would also benefit younger but disabl peopl .
have a quantit target for reduc poverti is problemat .
it potenti is far greater .
the sit is resum .
the culmin of this is in the treati of lisbon .
in mani case it goe beyond .
then , fourth , the access of the eu to the convent .
i just want to mention two of them .
howev , the access must meet two requir .
among these is the so-cal co-respond mechan ' .
this is what we are go to adopt now .
now there is a legal basi for the access becom a realiti .
we can all be plea about that .
it is a veri import step .
just today i spoke to some moroccan member of parliament .
the situat is a follow .
mr beňová and mr wikström have spoken about this .
whi do we need it ?
so final , thank to you , we have it .
i would also reinforc what mr sógor mention .
i would like to give a veri relev exampl .
this is a bizarr and downright scandal situat .
there is no problem .
protocol have sinc been ad to it over time .
i will not repeat it becaus i would say exact the same .
the debat is close .
written statement ( rule 149 )
i could cite quit a few recent exampl of that .
today , these are main econom migrant .
are we tri to stipul their recept via a circuit rout ?
i believ that the answer to this is a follow .
which area is cover by access ?
just the convent or it addit protocol a well ?
i firm believ that all these question will be answer soon .
the number of case increas signific from year to year .
electr car ( debat )
we therefor need to back european industri .
i shall end with a question to mr tajani .
the commiss tend to refer to clean propel vehicl generic .
howev electr propuls technolog is the most develop .
electromobl must play a key role in futur .
the follow point are crucial , howev .
we must not lag behind in this regard .
are the french quicker , or the german or the spaniard ?
we need to develop cost-effect , high-perform batteri .
we need to be abl to take these into account in futur .
electr vehicl includ train , tram , buse , car and bicycl .
at most , electr car solv the emiss problem .
the area of land use alon is immens .
it is current 117 hectar a day .
therefor , the number of car must be reduc .
the green will vote in favour of this resolut .
i am not an environment extremist .
there will certain be more room for discus there .
by the way , the electr bicycl i ride wa made in china .
noth much ha chang sinc then .
we now want a standardis electr car in the european union .
besid , an electr car is useless at the moment .
i will singl out three prioriti from your action plan .
first of all , the employe themselv .
i stress this particular issu to you .
third , the charg infrastructur .
otherwis , we will get bog down in a fragment market .
it is not too late to avoid that .
the technolog will choos itself .
might i suggest that you do your best to speed that up ?
anoth essenti factor will be the modernis of electr grid .
now , the electr car is a fine flagship .
europ ha a tradit and a reput when it come to qualiti .
these mayor came up with the idea of smart citi .
my countri , the netherland , ha made a choic .
we have said yes ' to a german plug .
i have two more point .
first of all , we lack a proper communic strategi .
put briefli , in urban condit these vehicl are too quiet .
we still have a larg number of item on the agenda .
let me explain myself better .
these vehicl are particular suit to urban drive .
in this respect , standardis of electr vehicl becom vital .
( e ) mr presid , europ 2020 and the electr car .
innov and competit are in themselv knowledg .
one is technolog and the other energi .
it is work now .
mani member state , in fact , are choos them .
i believ that europ ha a strategi .
we are more competit if we focus on innov and research .
the debat is close .
the vote will take place tomorrow .

this alway result in mention of the power of consum .
whi do we still not have it ?
that is someth we want to make possibl .

this will allow social decis on purchas choic to be made .

perhap you are not in a posit to answer that precis .
i will now move on to my final question .
do we have good crisi manag arrang for case like this ?
it also deal with volcan erupt a a secondari respons .
what other measur do they take ?
what el do you think that we can do ?
quit how , then , is this to be solv ?
who , exact , is to be compens ?
the airlin ?
do they then pas the money on to the passeng ?
whi should it onli be the airlin that receiv compens ?
thank you , madam presid .
thank you .
i simpli wish to rememb those who were affect .
first , there were the passeng .
i now come to the airlin .
the other victim ha been tourism .
the consequ for tourism have been devast .
this is my diagnosi , commission , ladi and gentleman .
i will now discus the commiss 's respons .
we are not talk about someth in the past .
i know that we can not fight the element .
the crisi will not help u to take measur .
the member state will be reluct to provid resourc .
we therefor welcom this approach by the commiss .
we need to know .
the necessari penalti proceed must natur follow .
let u not fool ourselv .
it is not go to go away ani time soon .
risk , a we all know and accept , is part of run a busi .
howev , these are except circumst .
for exampl , what would be the exact role ?
to whom would this person be account ?
how would this improv the current situat ?
that would sure be absurd .
the role of eurocontrol must also be close examin .
if there is one thing that tourism need , it is certainti .
this is , of cours , a signific loss .
i must ask you to continu work to this end .
i must ask you to continu work to this end .
everyon can remov the risk by simpli not fli .
and certain the evid is there for all to see .
i onli had three minut at the begin .
this will be a veri complic thing .
the safeti of plane and live must come first .
there is a respons , which main rest with the pilot .
this is a veri clear messag .
this is a differ word .
somebodi mention that they should have insur .
i ask them a well about the insur .
regard altern transport , we will , of cours , push ahead .
this is anoth interest stori .
the debat is close .
written statement ( rule 149 )
we do not have report on the damag to air transport .
in poland , the figur is 11 .
agenda for next sit : see minut
closur of the sit
open of the sit
( the sit wa open at 09.05 )
document receiv : see minut
the next item is :
the joint debat on mechan for strengthen econom order ,
there wa also a crisi in sovereign bond .
that is the situat .
it may have appear slow to take decis .
howev , obvious a short-term strategi is not enough .
we need to take medium and long-term measur .
it wa a respons that i would call a consolid pact .
of cours , it would be a mistak to stop our effort here .
i count on parliament 's support for these import propos .
our propos are base on two principl .
our propos are made of three build block .
we have neither the intent nor the resourc for that .
whi is this import ?
yes , we need to avoid moral hazard .
it is better to be safe than sorri .
mr presid , ladi and gentleman , europ ha final react .
well let u do it now !
this appli to both right-w and left-w govern .
we must learn lesson from all this .
this is how we are made , so there have to be penalti .
the commiss ask for this last week .
i myself ask for it in this chamber a few week ago .
this can not continu either .
my group is ask europ to wake up .
the commiss , mr rehn , must not be afraid of do this .
the system is wrong .
it is , to a certain extent , immor , and it is also warp .
let me put this in practic term .
this is a warp system .
it should be abolish and these practic should be ban .
howev , the pension fund then went bankrupt .
now it is the govern ' turn .
this is what you have said , mr lópez garrido and mr rehn .
they must be control and regul .
howev , this should not be happen now .
( protest )
that is a good thing .
i am realli sorri .
we have alleg creat an econom and monetari union .
in europ , we have a patchwork quilt of econom polici .
this repres a huge risk .
( applaus )
this is the situat we are in at the moment .
my second messag is for the commiss .
for the time be , then , we have a work group .
in my opinion , this is much too late .
that is what must be done .
first , strengthen the stabil and growth pact .
are you go to reach a conclus in june ?
will it be the open method of coordin onc again ?
final , we must have a european bond market .
this is what we are expect from the commiss , mr rehn .
( applaus )
this is noth new for my group .
it ha been a tradit for u for mani year .
the euro wa not stabilis dure the weekend befor last .
the share price demonstr veri clear what had happen .
i would like to summaris the situat veri briefli .
we must now make clear decis on certain issu .
we can genuin guarante their involv by introduc the tax .
i am veri familiar with this term in a german context .
i would like to make one final point .
the introduct of new tax is a taboo subject .
( applaus )
this approach miss the point .
sanction were previous avail ; they simpli lack credibl .
would the new measur be taken ani more serious ?
we have also spoken out in prais of this .
these govern have save casino capit use taxpay ' money .
somewher , they manag to find eur 750 billion .
i believ that it is more like to save the bank ' capit .
howev , i can not yet see ani clear outlin .
what we are lack is a social union .
hedg fund must be ban and tax haven abolish .
howev , we can not tri and stimul growth at the same time .
plea keep to your time next time .
could you explain whi this is ?
those speech did , inde , run over by some second .
we do not want ani farm to burn down .
we want to take precaut , that is our object .
howev , that is simpli not of interest to some peopl .
we must reduc the differ in competit .
we must also look at the budget .
we need to see intellig measur taken by govern .
yes , we need to balanc our budget .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
the public sector wa out of control for mani year .
we had the stabil pact .
what did mr prodi say about the stabil pact in 2002 ?
you know : you were the head of mr liikanen 's cabinet .
he said the stabil pact wa stupid .
so we had to chang it .
this wa the guardian of the treati .
mr president-in-offic ( from spain ) : do we need taxat ?
no , it make thing even wors .
i understand the german taxpay .
so what is he tri to prove ?
you have brought the imf back into the european fold .
whi were we not consult about this decis ?
you talk unceas of deficit and debt .
whi , though , do we never talk about exist revenu option ?
we need true solidar ...
( the presid cut off the speaker )
you have not allow regul to be impos when they were need .
just one exampl of this is eurostat .
who block this move ?
what we realli need is , of cours , not an emerg govern .
the deficit and sanction procedur need to be autom .
we need inform , but without advanc authoris .
my eighth point is direct at the council .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
i will make a deal with you .
we in the european parliament are present concret propos .
plea help to make sure that this happen in the council .
in my opinion , we should set two target .
we must do both thing at the same time .
expenditur can be cut or tax can be increas .
unfortun , you do not have ani plan in this area .
greec will be no differ .
countri fail to do those thing must leav the euro area .
you did not do so .
in ani case , the eu alway take the opportun ...
( the presid cut off the speaker )
this would realli just mean go from bad to wors .
the commiss ha toler all of this .
i would like to join in mr verhofstadt 's critic .
it ha not come up with ani idea or ani incent .
the commiss ha accept everyth that ha been thrown at it .
i can onli agre with mr bullmann in this respect .
where are the concret propos ?
that is simpli not enough .
that is the caus of this crisi .
i think this is irrespons .
the crisi is not the euro crisi in greec ' .
sail a ship through a storm is not easi .
i have a messag for each of you .
do not put your name to this mockeri .
a mr verhofstadt said , we need anoth way .
we also need financi supervis .
i am rapporteur for the european system risk board .
your presid is respons for this packag .
be ambiti !
you have our support .
this is exact what our govern have also been do .
eu 2020 should lay the bill at the right door .
this way , we preserv the european social model .
the rich will get richer and the poor will get poorer .
i will make an attempt with europeanist rhetor .
the commiss must take action in this area .
this is urgent need .
we need more europ and not le europ .
this may well be our last chanc .
i am not think just of financi crise here .
global govern is be establish .
what influenc will european have ?
and what is happen now ?
growth mean invest .
we must face the fact .
there are three issu that must be tackl .
this crisi doe not remain static .
it is not onli a crisi of the euro .
whi are we in this situat ?
both citizen and market need more europ .
now i am all for free market ; protection doe not work .
but are our market free ?
what is be done to polic this ?
i repres the last countri to join the euro area .
last year , larg sum of money were inject into bank .
the crisi ha continu .
the growth and stabil pact ha not been adher to .
unaccept deficit have been run up .
state have taken differ measur in similar situat .
we need financi stabil .
mr presid , i will abid by your rule .
on the other hand , it provid an opportun a well .
they must be adapt accord to the possibl of each countri .
the first victim wa greec , follow by spain and portug .
we need to learn from this advers .
we know that - histori ha taught u .
a vein of nation self-assert can certain be detect here .
by all mean scrutinis other countri , but not mine .
scrutinis greec , spain and portug , but not my countri .
noli me tanger - touch me not !
our mutual depend requir open and trust .
take a look at asia , commission .
howev , there are other distinct problem .
join the eurozon at this moment is not just a privileg .
( the presid interrupt the speaker )
we have to appreci them dear .
otherwis , it will go bad .
i am sorri to interrupt you .
we need a vision of a market economi .
we must now bring it to life .
competit is not the start but the result of econom activ .
the answer is no ' .
countri which commit fraud must leav .
that appli to govern a well a to individu .
econom govern should now be propos a a matter of urgenc .
person , i do not think we should switch hors .
i would like to ask : where wa the european central bank ?
where wa the commiss ?
the respons wa to move forward and adopt a new treati .
that is the way to respond to this situat right now .
the first aspect is solidar .
therefor we can do it , of cours we can do it .
third , we need to commit to competit .
we can not wait much longer for this .
do not expect anyth el ; expect u to do precis that .
we have to work on three strength .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
colleagu , this is the round-up of a veri import debat .
the commission ha the floor .
ten page sound short , but it is full of concret initi .
this is heavi stuff , which is what we need in europ .
we have taken the initi and we shall move on .
we do not have the luxuri of time .
instead , we must act without delay .
it is now absolut essenti to move on with these initi .
the debat is close .
written statement ( rule 149 )
it doe not , howev , go far enough .
the content is limit and pessimist .
the figur for youth unemploy are alarm .
predict suggest that there will be a shortag of worker .
we need concret measur .
the young need job , not promis .
i must admit that the minist 's argument is convinc .
i hope these appeal will be heard and put into practic .
the dawdl probabl caus the situat to escal .
these effect are much to be desir and veri ambiti .
howev , i think this will be difficult to achiev .
the economi of europ are strong link .
the new strategi is base on veri ambiti idea .
thank you .
calendar of part-sess
can you plea stop it ?
( applaus )
i am call for this to be stop .
the presid ha taken note to act accord .

( applaus )
befor the vote :

befor the vote on amend 3 :
we shall now proceed to the vote .
( for the result and other detail on the vote : see minut )
explan of vote
i would like to ask you to check whether amend 4 wa unlaw .
i would realli like to clarifi that this is unlaw .
we are deal with explan of vote concern the amend budget .
oral explan of vote
this will cost taxpay an addit eur 13.4 million per year .
it is not an amend which onli concern account .
this amend make veri good sen .
how is this ?
we have just one or two peopl to support u .
so it is not a save which we are ostens talk about , here .
it is simpli a respons to a new function , a new role .
that is one of the most import object .
we have to close the gap .
let our surgeon do their work .
let our patient be treat .
this is the gift of life .
we must defus the debat about meat glue .
thrombin is natur present in all meat .
whi should we ban thrombin ?
to do so would be to open pandora 's box .
is it realli the job of politician to manag our food ?
where will it end ?
it is pure popul .
what is the evid ?
what is thrombin ?
thrombin is a natur enzym .
it form part of the blood and therefor of meat .
all of u have a lot of thrombin in our bodi .
we will be vote on the first read of this regul in june .
today , we had to vote on glu meat .
the decis today wa not an easi one for me .
this mean that it may be use but not indic on the label .
( de ) mr presid , the citizen of europ are right .
they like honest food and they like honest politician .
i respect public opinion of this kind .
that is not the case .
we must take notic of what our citizen are say to u .
we do not want glu meat in europ .
this is the basi for effect and fair consum protect .
one final remark about glu ham .
i fear that we are get mix up in someth rather complic .
all eu member state have ratifi the rome statut .
these crime can not be commit with impun .
written explan of vote
i support this import report .
nevertheless , the direct seem to have the right object .
i vote for this report .
that is whi i vote a i did .
i therefor support this report .
the treati of lisbon ha given parliament new respons .
this situat lead to increas cost .
that is whi i vote a i did .
i vote in favour .
to do that , resourc are need .
consequ , ukip member vote against this report .
howev , there are still long wait list for transplant .
for all these reason , we vote for this propos .
that is whi i vote a i did .
therefor , we are plea to welcom it .
a for the circus ' , it should obvious stop !
thrombin is use a a glue ' in reconstitut meat .
the commiss 's propos do not fulli deal with these reserv .
we therefor deem this resolut worthi of our support .
the text ha no valid scientif basi .
it is authoris in franc and use in black pud , for exampl .
let u not lap into an emot debat !
i therefor welcom this vote reject this enzym .
the key thing here is the safeti of substanc .
thrombin is current in use .
after today , it will not be permit .
there is a differ .
that is whi i vote a i did .
i vote in favour of it , nonetheless .
i do not think that the food industri should be an except .
clear , accur label is obvious import .
i therefor agre with the opinion express in the resolut .
i am veri plea with today 's vote ban thrombin .
this is a victori for consum .
this is high decept .
i can not quit see how this benefit consum .
this is whi i vote in favour of this resolut .
fund the medic system doe not come cheap .
the figur speak for themselv .
everi day , 12 of them die .
howev , there are still long wait list for transplant .
addit , there are tight time constraint on organ viabil .
that is whi i vote a i did .
i therefor vote in favour .
this ha been acknowledg by all the rapporteur and group .
ladi and gentleman , the statist speak for themselv .
everi day , 12 peopl die wait for an organ transplant .
it is also import to mobilis and inform societi .
i welcom this develop .
this need to chang .
for all these reason , i vote against the resolut .
the most serious crime against human must be punish .
the intern crimin court could be a use tool in this area .
it is just a question of actual give it the resourc .
a this is not happen , i am abstain .
therefor , i vote in favour .
correct to vote and vote intent : see minut
approv of the minut of the previous sit : see minut
the next item is the joint debat on the follow :
this is inde a veri coher packag .
return to my report : it is an implement report .
what have we laid down ?
in europ , we have first-class research .
yet what is lag behind is the utilis of this research .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
( the presid cut off the speaker )
the ecofin council had to start all over again on monday .
these are the signal that parliament must send out .
thus , a certain flexibl should be allow for .
the singl market integr process is not an irrevers one .
it current situat need to be challeng .
perhap i am be too demand , though .
this is not all doom and gloom .
we must restor confid .
this work clear compris mani aspect .
when we talk about europ 2020 , what are we talk about ?
there are also certain requir where implement is concern .
these will onli be adopt onc you have tabl your opinion .
europ 2020 mean the willing to bring about a polit union .
the decis that we take today must be long-term decis .
europ need a forward-look union .
and here i have some question mark .
an inclus societi need more job .
unemploy is the main reason whi poverti exist .
youth unemploy in spain , at 44 % , is devast .
to do this , we absolut must have european coordin .
what are your propos ?
you are not entitl to stay silent .
but , on the other hand , it is rather an unfocus debat .
he talk about the seven flagship initi .
well , we do not know the detail of those yet .
they will get the benefit .
it is the biggest singl underdevelop polici that we have .
we have the instrument , but we need to carri them out .
we want to introduc a whole raft of specif chang .
none of that ha been incorpor into the strategi .
the strategi right cover healthi public financ .
howev , the initi will be use onli if two condit are met .
that prove to be a complet failur , of cours .
are you surpris that our economi is stagnat ?
greec clear must be expel from the euro area .
i alreadi know your answer : absolut noth .
on this point , the socialist are fail .
mr ulvskog from sweden propos increas spend .
no , sir .
these are our strong point .
these are our hope .
what determin our growth ?
a great deal more could be done in those area .
i address those word to commission andor .
howev , we also to need to improv the guidelin .
none of the new countri are like to be contributor .
unfortun and unfair , the uk taxpay is caught up in this .
by 2020 , the gap will be unbridg .
the 2020 strategi , therefor , miss the point .
for 40 mep , that make two interpret per person .
howev , what is need is better coordin between them .
we need true european solidar .
commission , my question is therefor veri simpl .
instead they are move backward .
it is therefor simpli a matter of get start .
of cours we need to come up with a good definit .
that is what the real debat is about .
i hope that , a commission , you are prepar to do this .
i can confirm this with one concret exampl .
when there were problem there , they call for more social .
let u build on a foundat of nation state .
let u creat job and the right condit .
that will be the sourc of our strength .
that is how we will make progress .
small enterpris are crucial .
that is precis the state of affair right now !
nor should the cohes polici ignor the euro crisi .
what is need then ?
all of that should be includ in the europ 2020 strategi .
face with the financi crisi , europ ha not been inact .
we do not say this often enough .
our fellow citizen often ask u : what is europ do ? '
we must meet their expect .
your ambiti but essenti timet ha our support .
we are at a turn point , fellow member .
it ha been a veri interest report to work on .
that is exact what we need .
it is not the whole stori , though .
the commiss ha a total lack of ambit in this regard .
hard a word ha been said about the bank .
that wa my first point .
howev , we must also look at the economi of the futur .
here , too , the commiss ha too littl ambit .
we feel the commiss 's plan should cover this , too .
we need solut to work effect for our citizen .
the situat call for real solidar .
this is the ultim european paradox .
extraordinari situat requir clear joint action .
we must do this or risk compromis our futur .
i should like to highlight one such idea .
innov polici should be aim at them also .
the challeng face europ over the next few year are enorm .
we therefor need to take them serious in this strategi .
we need to do someth about this .
these are subject for the member state .
we need to start talk about growth and develop again .
otherwis , the futur could be even more terrifi .
what are the prospect for 2020 ?
propos have been made .
both report ultim stress the posit impact of this measur .
that must be one of our object .
the commiss is activ explor the possibl solut .
mani such cut would affect educ .
the commiss will continu to watch this issu care .
in some countri , financi constraint will onli appear now .
we can not employ a one-size-fits-al polici .
each case merit individu attent .
that will not achiev anyth .
peopl need to be safe and secur in order to be flexibl .
the commiss must do more to address social dump .
in fact , we have been consum by it .
final , there is a major crisi in youth unemploy .
we need to clarifi certain point .
enough talk .
that is the point of my speech .
keep it simpl .
( fr ) mr koumoutsako , you do have some cheek !
do you have a repli to this question , mr koumoutsako ?
( el ) sir , your speech is the result of poor inform .
that is how we arriv at today 's drastic situat .
i am not impli anyth of the sort .
let u not be dogmat .
this situat requir that we act intellig .
howev , it is not the time which is worst here .
basic , there is noth supran about these issu .
they are matter for which individu countri are respons .
this is not a greek crisi .
intern summit are now ignor ; what will be , will be .
so now what is everybodi say ?
that the market must be reassur .
who is the market , though ?
these are the point i wish to offer for your consider .
invest in it bear no risk .
to agricultur !
it should go to the young generat , and their develop .
short-term measur will have a high long-term cost .
the eu 2020 strategi can be differ .
onli just under a half of all older worker have a job .
this is a situat we can not accept .
howev , a genuin futur strategi need a social orient .
commission andor , we are both work on that .
what doe this mean in concret term ?
cultur must not be neglect in european polici .
that will mean a huge burden on nation economi .
we should not , howev , make a mysteri out of debt .
that will not be smart or intellig .
ten year ago , we adopt a strategi , the lisbon strategi .
will there be inflat ?
this is where we should be focus our effort .
the citizen must be healthi and educ and must have work .
( lv ) thank you , mr presid .
i have a dog at home .
recent , my dog took a sausag from the tabl and ate it .
is the dog to blame , for do what is natur to it ?
who is to blame for this ?
thank you .
howev , i would like to make the follow point .
greec is not take money from other nation .
we are not take money from other nation .
( el ) you are absolut right mr rapti .
i am great concern about our futur togeth in the eu .
four out of five european live in urban area .
three of these seem to me , commission , to be prioriti .
first , the eu 2020 strategi must be an inclus strategi .
some of these have been met , but a lot of them have not .
if we work togeth , we will be much stronger .
what sort of life will our citizen be abl to live here ?
what realli are the major issu we face today ?
second , we alreadi have high govern deficit .
now it is time to save .
this is one of the main problem .
that ha to be our start point .
soft , soft ' will not do anymor .
we have to up our game .
this is the problem with strategi .
they had not caus this metamorphosi .
no one can ass it long-term consequ at this stage .
we were unit in diver ; now we must be unit in advers .
( applaus )
i would like to leav this worri behind now .
we are conduct this debat in much too technocrat a way .
the disquiet with such procedur is veri much in evid .
a top-down europ can not work .
now , that is a contradict .
howev , the european union today is much more than that .
i should just like to emphasis two particular aspect .
elsewher , it bemoan the fact that europ ha an age popul .
this would certain redress the popul balanc .
it ha also place the focus on the role of territori cohes .
it ha a dual object .
these are all veri import element .
i wish to make two more comment : one about govern .
it ha been ask whose strategi this actual is .
the whole thing is far too flat .
first , the ecb can now monetis sovereign debt .
commission , we socialist are in favour of feder .
we are in favour of the coordin of budget polici .
i ask you to acknowledg this .
the item is close .
written statement ( rule 149 )
structur reform are the key to exit the crisi we are in .
innov must featur a part of region develop .
univers busi dialogu ( debat )
these issu were also address in your report .
mr scurria refer earlier to mobil .
educ and work are interwoven concept .
what sort of skill ?
we simpli can not afford to remain where we are .
the second thing i would like to mention is mobil .
research can also build bridg between univers and busi .
it thus receiv absolut unequivoc support from both parti .
the key issu , howev , is how to achiev these link .
we are all tri to understand the aspir of our young peopl .
that is the real key to lifelong mobil .
so what of modernis ?
do you look for the technolog develop of the futur ?
if so , the scene today is just a promis .
this tide of higher educ often return home .
we are live in a time of technic revolut .
this report reflect outdat and fail think .
that also appli to mr repo and mr vergiat .
we need this cooper at local , nation and intern level .
we must support univers .
this report therefor strike precis the right chord .
no , it is good .
i think that is realli what we are talk about .
what would you prefer ?
i leav you with that question .
in recent time , i have seen three great exampl of that .
all these thing are veri import .
( applaus )
i , too , wish to congratul the rapporteur .
that is just what we need .
after all , busi doe not set itself such an object .
( ro ) i partial agre with the rapporteur .
one of the main reason for this is the lack of money .
howev , they are lose their research to the american .

what is happen ?
what we need are worldwid rule .
this is also a step in the right direct .
overal , the spanish presid wa a success presid .
thank you for your effort and thank you for your attent .
this wa absolut the correct approach in the crisi .
we all know how diplomat mr barroso is .
the crisi ha shown that this approach ha fail .
much the same goe for the eu 2020 strategi .
that is precis the case , howev .
the open method of coordin broke down .
here , too , we need more european cooper .
the new strategi doe not do this to a suffici degre .
this hous ha call for a differ approach .
there is one final comment i should like to make .
mr presid , i shall make no remark about footbal .
i know you are all too clever for that .
i shall onli say it is a piti that ghana ha been elimin .
we can all agre on that , can we not ?
we have indulg in empti rhetor .
that will not work .
that mean you can alreadi mothbal 2020 .
we are alway say we want growth , growth , growth .
yes , but what sort of growth ?
those who want growth can not onli get growth by save .
we need a european fund .
yes , but it must be a fund for solidar and invest .
where today is europ speak about invest ?
i have not heard it mention onc in ani of the speech .
i have heard noth about that today - not a word .
i would like to reiter someth with regard to swift .
one forc can not monitor the other .
there is a real problem of dysfunct .
that is the plain truth .
there is great consensus .
it is a photocopi , mr presid .
general strike .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
they have alreadi paid , mr zapatero .
my constitu regular ask who is run spain .
none of this ha come to pas .
let u move on to some detail .
goodby , then , to the spanish presid .
he continu to be late and unsuccess .
( applaus )
abov all , it did so with result .
it ha also been polit .
the lesson from this is clear .
in no case should we be disunit in the face of advers .
from now on , everi presid must think global , not local .
( applaus )
we will continu demand a voic for europ 's region .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
swift is not good news to me ; it is veri bad news .
the spanish presid ha left no endur trace , mr zapatero .
i shall mention just a few point .
i would queri this .
not even the presid of this hous wa involv .
we have no concret progress on the stabil and growth pact .
these are the fact .
so , this is hard a success report card .
that would assist the inner coher of your argument .
( applaus )
it is the spanish presid that we are discus .
mr zapatero said he ha accomplish everyth in good faith .
the realiti is differ .
we could still do that too , mr schulz .
( applaus )
it is a solid record of achiev .
your european presid ha been veri poor .
you have avoid the big decis .
i see that you agre with the final solut ' for catalan .
when will kosovo be recognis ?
mani of u have spent a lot longer put up with this model .
mr zapatero , do not resent these word of open critic .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
session had , at best , an inform charact .
answer to question were unsatisfactori .
this ha now chang .
for this , it deserv the prais of this hous .
howev , it wa up to you to demand obedi to these rule .
unlik me , you have had time to talk about them .
democraci is a public opinion-bas system .
at best , this presid ha been sad irrelev .
the spanish also met high expect on democrat right .
congratul !
this is someth which caus u veri great concern .
this crisi ha hit the countri hold the presid veri hard .
last week 's economist ask : is there life after debt ? ' .
the spectr of financi collaps also hung over spain itself .
nevertheless , the presid wa uniqu .
the spanish presid ha also embark on econom govern .
( applaus )
( applaus )
howev , in my opinion , we have other thing to do here .
now let u see what the result is .
( applaus )
let u , therefor , look at the fact .
yes , yes , let u look at the fact .
howev , in the end , that is how thing are .
from the start .
we will fulfil each and everi one of our commit .
what is import is the talli of agreement .
i reject it utter .
my countri is under the rule of law .
( applaus )
we will work and do whatev is in our power .
we have felt support by you , mr presid .
we have felt understood by you , encourag by you .
( applaus )
mr presid , i will be veri brief .
how would the rotat presid interpret the treati of lisbon ?
the treati of lisbon stand for more europ , not le europ .
and the spanish presid 's interpret favour more europ .
spain ha set an exampl .
this commiss is le than five month old .
thank you , mr barroso .
that complet this item .
written statement ( rule 149 )
the slow solut were subsequ of poor qualiti .
it wa a difficult and a signific presid .
( the sit wa suspend for sever minut )
well , let it be so .
parliament ha clear play it part in this .
the new agreement wa approv on 28 june 2010 .
articl 18 is a good articl .
articl 12 repres a second improv .
this is a methodolog we need to master .
we need to further strengthen our own institut .
we need to have faith in them .
i would like to thank all of you wholeheart .
let me just mention a few point .
the rapporteur laid out the provis that we will take .
this is a major achiev .
the london bomb took place exact five year ago .
( applaus )
it is a new start , a mr malmström said .
the text of this agreement is not perfect .
we have been construct from the start .
it is certain more equal , more open and more democrat .
that is exact whi this agreement is need .
now is the time for u to behav reason and respons .
mr presid , ladi and gentleman , what are we talk about ?
now the transfer of bulk data is here .
this agreement ha mani weak point .
look at the way that this wa done .
the usa can not be trust to observ other nation ' right .
they have no right to share it with the usa or anybodi el .
by what right ?
the uk independ parti will vote against .
the global jihad pose an increas threat to the world .
let u be veri clear about this .
it wa a terribl stench ; the stench of terror .
with this agreement , we have done just this .
we have shown that we can have them both .
we have shown that we can strike a fair balanc .
this is not a zero-sum game .
( de ) mr presid , a preliminari remark .
more object and le emot would sure have been fit .
to reiter , intra-european transfer are not affect .
nonetheless , not everyth wa achiev .
for exampl , europol .
( applaus )
let u also respect those not in agreement .
the commiss ha an essenti role to play in promot this .
i believ that the agreement is use .
i do not serious believ that we can reject this agreement .
( c ) i reject the argument put forward by the oppon .
( hu ) i will inde keep this one short .
from now on , the legal remedi offer will be transpar .
we also said that an independ court could chang a decis .
we must keep a close eye on this balanc .
this is an evolutionari process .
these are all posit step .
you may or may not like this agreement .
compromis is the veri essenc of the communiti method .
that is simpli not true .
the debat is close .
the vote will take place on thursday , 8 juli , at 12:00 .
τhe next item is the vote .
written statement ( rule 149 )
this is not a perfect agreement .
the data will be arbitrarili store for a full five year .
even the rapporteur admit that he is not total satisfi .
mani question remain open and in need of answer .

what doe the european parliament want in addit ?
we must carri on further along this road .

i am particular concern about the area of rural transport .
( lv ) thank you , mr presid .
that is whi i support this report .
thank you .
mea culpa . i take the lesson .
it is not , howev , enough on it own .
instead , we need veri practic action .
( lt ) youth unemploy is a particular acut problem today .
20 % of peopl my age are unemploy in the european union .
the situat vari from one eu member state to anoth .
it constitut a general framework , and i agre with it aim .
written explan of vote
this is an issu which i think is veri import .
nevertheless , it is a good exampl .
at present , 24 member state have integr this convent .
that is whi i vote in favour of the resolut .
thank you .
in this way , countri are oblig to admit the good .
this is whi i vote in favour of this report .
i am vote against this report .

this ha my uncondit support .
therefor , i am vote for the ep posit .
furthermor , articl 3 state that '1 .
member shall vote on an individu and person basi .
this situat is reprehens , unaccept and scandal .
it goe without say that this is a scandal .
this kind of thing must never happen again .
i therefor vote in favour of this report .
harmonis of statist data collect ;
i therefor vote in favour .
i support this report .
these are four particular import step for lithuania .
this elimin is necessari for the preserv of our ecosystem .
it must be carri out a quick a possibl .
the implement of the strategi ha been slow so far .
we need to kick-start the process and step up our effort .
i congratul the rapporteur on a veri well draft report .
i support this report .
i fulli welcom this report .
i abstain from vote on the report .
no proper impact ass have been carri out in this regard .
howev , it seem prefer to me to abstain on amend 14 .
all of this had to do with a vote at second read .
rural bus servic are vital to rural life .
these servic should also be access to peopl with disabl ;
i am sure that the council ha taken note of our determin .
now we go into concili .
therefor , we have vote in favour .
all of this had to do with a vote at second read .
combat exclus is a prioriti for the eu .
this mean that there need to be invest in termin and port .
the netherland itself is best place to make tailor polici .
this compel u to vote against this propos .
consum right must be protect .
i hope that an accept compromis can be reach in concili .
the correct function of the intern market must be ensur .
i am plea that it wa adopt with a resound major .
the eu airlin industri is alreadi in dire strait .
transport is respons for 25 % of co2 emiss in europ .
the realiti is a bit differ , howev .
there is not much evid of collect ambit .
i endors the final version of the report .
i am vote against this report .
we are a far away a ever from achiev sustain in transport .
that is whi i abstain .
the verts/al group vote in favour .
we look posit on the heavi emphasi on safeti .
this is whi i vote against amend 6 .
it also boost employ .
i wa plea to hear the result of today 's vote .
i have doubt about the propos to creat a transport fund .
parliament is direct elect by the public .
thus , the outcom could have been better .
this is far too high a number .
my amend to the text were insert in this vein .
unemploy among young peopl is a huge problem .
that is whi we abstain .
it is certain import to tighten the regul on internship .
this is an unsustain situat .
internship should not destroy job .
we believ that this give a wrong messag .
the key factor should be the durat of an internship .
from then on , remuner should also be paid .
the decis made today is impractic and goe too far .
we therefor do not support this part of the resolut .
that is whi i vote for this report .
youth unemploy is one of europ 's most press problem .
a european qualiti charter on internship is to be propos .
this send out a clear signal to our young european .
we often say that young peopl are the futur of europ .
unfortun , the outlook is not promis either .
that is whi i vote a i did .
this trend continu to grow dure the recess .
internship are also the caus of much emot .
the european union must have common strategi .
in an ideal world , youth unemploy would be outlaw .
that is the thrust of the turunen report .
it sketch new way to curb youth unemploy .
this is becaus we alway rememb our first salari .
we must also ensur that these are of good qualiti .
the report wa adopt with a larg major in favour .
vocat train is indispens .
we have vote in favour of the report .
this is almost doubl the averag unemploy rate .
address this is an import task for respons politician .
my contribut wa base along two line .
these have a greater impact on young peopl and woman .
inflex model of labour law have proven to have fail .
i therefor support mr gruni 's report .
atyp employ contract must remain the except in europ .
the abus of atyp employ breach the european social model .
the text is not damag but relat weak .
there wa , unfortun , no chanc to secur a major for it .
we therefor go further in our altern resolut .
there must not be two class of employ contract .
this is import .
allow me to give you one exampl of this .
i am therefor vote in favour of this report 's propos .
ever greater area are experienc irrepar soil degrad here .
european now understand the need to sort wast .
howev , bio-wast almost alway end up in landfil .
our posit is ambiti and realist .
the question unansw in the report is : who will pay ?
this report take the right approach .
i welcom this .
i will therefor abstain .
this wa includ in the recit of the text adopt in committe .
correct to vote and vote intent : see minut
approv of the minut of the previous sit : see minut
unfortun , the crisi ha shown that we were right .
a a result , the commiss provid detail propos on 12 may .
these propos do not involv chang the treati .
this is not a limit .
it is our respons to decid and to act now .
our respons to the crisi is a holist one .
we stabilis , we consolid and we modernis .
but for now , let me focus on govern .
we have the treati provis in place which allow u to act .
we have the institut .
we need to make it work .
we face a real risk and we success resist it .
this work ha help to build a real european momentum .
we need a stronger surveil regim .
what doe this mean in detail ?
first , we need more coordin .
key to this is the european semest ' .
second , we need the credibl that come with better enforc .
i want to be veri clear on this .
the time of measur is also key .
third , our surveil need to captur all the key element .
it must not be restrict to fiscal polici alon .
we have seen that such a narrow perspect doe not work .
( applaus )
this will creat job and prosper for our citizen .
you call the seri of measur a toolbox ' .
the commiss ha the initi here .
we can not just say that we will reduc the deficit .
the fourth element is the stress test ' .
this is a crucial point .
this is the point of departur for the larosièr exercis .
the member state have not yet understood .
mr presid , mani thank for make this statement .
a far a i see it , we will not make ani progress this way .
it also specif mention imbal .
unfortun , this doe not featur in the text .
we have problem with asset price and bubbl .
this is not mention explicit either .
it is no longer enough now to make progress in this crisi .
we need to arriv at consensus .
i do not agre with this conclus .
regul of the financi market is a matter of urgenc .
we will do our part to resolv the situat .
i think you had an urgent appoint .
you are in such a pickl actual , are you not ?
you threw it away !
i am not a johnny-come-l to the demis of the euro .
it wa alway written in the rune , a it were .
they redistribut junk debt repackag at tripl a rate .
what are our central bank do now ?
the veri same thing .
today , you are rush u toward a social and polit explos .
that is precis our goal with youth 2020 .
we will come with formal propos .
what is go on is a veri import reform .
there is a predomin sen of construct pragmat on both side .
i am grate for the ambit parliament ha been demonstr .
i am grate for your strong support .
i believ it now appear within grasp .
we now call on both colegisl to maintain the posit dynam .
great , and we welcom that .
that could onli enhanc the role of europ in this matter .
final , some of you spoke about stress test .
a fulli transpar stress test provid the opportun to do so .
so , a you see , we are act on sever front .
( applaus )
the debat is close .
written statement ( rule 149 )
in write . - i welcom the propos made by the commiss .
europ is about mutual and close interdepend .
howev , control mechan are not a solut but just a mean .
they should not be overestim .
the key to the solut is prevent .
the new dual system of incent and sanction deserv support .
i also encourag make better use of eurostat .
this is all the result of illog and unclear tax legisl .
the next item is the joint debat on the follow :
( applaus )
the trialogu began the follow day .
this is the decis we have come to now in parliament .
then we have the long debat about direct decis right .
will the council ever do this ?
so far , the council appear inflex .
it is now over to the council .
sinc then , the commiss ha done it work .
it commiss a report from jacqu de larosièr .
first , there are the issu concern effici .
we do not need a safeguard claus .
all of that is grotesqu .
on this matter , we have also made some request .
we have also ask for greater open from these bodi .
first , we refus ani feder state .
then , later , we alway compar ourselv to the unit state .
there come a time when we have to abid by our respons .
i want a stronger europ .
she also bore a cur : that of not be listen to .
for this reason , troy fell .
they can onli be supervis by european author .
we did not take heed of this , and the crisi erupt .
now what ?
the belgian presid ha shown great will .
it ha ask u for time .
what doe it mean to say that they are european ?
this govern everyth except system institut .
the council ha ask for time .
parliament ha given it time .
let nobodi be confus , howev : this is not a sign of weak .
this is a sign of the strength of this hous .
i ask the council to listen to cassandra for onc .
today , cassandra is the rapporteur who have spoken .
cassandra is also commission barnier .
do not say one thing here and anoth there .
god and this hous .
they will not be differ but they will be balanc .
this is a real gain for parliament .
for pension , the question is up in the air .
we need to prepar conting plan .
this entir process take time for 27 member state .
there again , an agreement is not far away .
i count on your support on these veri import endeavour .
there is also financi corpor govern and bank capit .
i will come back to this when talk about mr kara ' report .
we need this credibl european architectur of supervis .
i want to repeat what mr garcía-margallo y marfil said .
other have also said this .
you can count on me to be avail .
there have been differ approach adopt at nation level .
it is obvious that this can not work .
the council onli take a narrow-mind approach .
the public do not find this polici accept .
we expect the council to take action .
it will requir the regul of rate agenc .
a regul at the european level is use , but insuffici .
we must have global supervis of financi market .
our member state are right to resist such a move .
let u now begin the debat with the polit group speaker .
the problem ha alreadi been explain .
we are deal with market which oper global nowaday .
if they are toxic , whi authoris them ?
it is obvious ask for bind action .
all of this doe not seem to me to amount to extrem .
whi can the council not accept that ?
i can think of no other name for that than a polit feder .
we have currenc union .
we need to do someth without give you a say . '
in my opinion , that is the wrong approach .
this would be just the first step to a status quo ant .
my group support strong european regul .
final , i am convinc that polit should take more respons .
everi year , these organis gobbl up eur 1.5 billion .
unfortun , they often take a ridicul stanc .
whi is this ?
howev , this is onli a start .
well , the solut is quit easi .
instead , oversight should begin in our countri .
who decid that ?
i am glad that it appear that we are close to agreement .
( hu ) the crisi ha taught u all some pain lesson .
the new supervisori author will serv exact this purpos .
parliament should also make concess .
therefor , it seem to me that our respons is clear .
we need regul and supervis .
we need more involv from europ .
we need decis without further notic in emerg .
we requir bank supervis a part of crisi manag .
we need strong supervis with teeth .
we want to keep system risk perman to a minimum .
if they fail to perform , they have somebodi to answer to .
that is a key messag .
the problem is that we ignor asset inflat .
mr bowl remind u of the need for earli intervent measur .
i think that these are good idea .
we are inde carri out this reform for the citizen .
this is veri much a reform for the citizen .
you remind u of the import of appli our rule proper .
we therefor have the same road map .
our bank sector are quit dissimilar .
in the unit state , it is the other way around .
we do not alway have the same bank structur .
the euro wa creat 11 year ago .
they have done an excel job , which ha not yet born fruit .
parliament tabl a last-minut compromis last week .
this method will fail .
mr presid , commission , i would like to say three thing .
let u be quit clear .
we have made an effort .
this should not end up a cherri pick .
i can not mention all of them .
my second remark ha to do with the date .
the date is not a fetish .
we do not want 1 januari for it own sake .
it is 1 januari with good reason .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
he repli no , it 's much more serious than that ' .
i would like to thank everybodi who ha particip in this .
we should be proud .
on an intern level , we should be proud too .
you will not be surpris to hear that .
i do not agre with use histor trend .
we have gone through full time , we are now in extra time .
let u hope it doe not have to go to a penalti shoot-out .
the joint debat is close .
written statement ( rule 149 )
a bit more hast would have been use , and perhap cheaper .
there remain mani other question .
is this all the right way around ?
i would now like to turn to eurobond .
market forc are not popular right now .
mr bowl mention angel .
what is the link with the ceil on own resourc ?
notabl , it will includ an impact evalu of the text .
it will not lend or borrow on behalf of this mechan .
no exact choic of legal basi ha yet been made .
howev , i wish to say the follow on the subject .
in the meantim , the market have done their job .
we did this in an emerg .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
this is a good cours of action .
thank you for your understand .
besid , the issu aris concern the depend of rate agenc .
i believ that this is the crux of stabilis .
ani reduct of this programm would be total counterproduct .
would you have a suggest to make on this ?
i would simpli like to ask you a question , commission .
he will do this in write in the next few day .
howev , this is onli a tool , mr kara .
mr berè mention the applic of the stabil pact .
like you , i think that we must go further .
the debat is close .
the next item is the joint debat on :
we have a duti to respond to the public 's concern .
bonus should not just be guarante .
i think that we can go even further in this matter .
i agre with your observ , mr el khadraoui .
i think that that is fair .
i have begun this task .
i have just refer to crd 3 and the issu of remuner .
i am veri awar of this risk .
we are in favour of maximum limit .
we are in favour of payment method involv le risk .
we are in favour of liabil .
we have manag to get our way with split the timet .
that will reduc the risk level and increas stabil .
it is too riski for societi to larg accept the status quo .
now , there is an import issu at stake .
a we lost , we have had to make compromis .
we have here a regul which is uniqu on a global scale .
in the end , we succeed in achiev a relat balanc result .
i fulli concur with him on them .
the financi crisi is obvious a global crisi .
the level play field must be retain .
for exampl , text and annex must remain consist .
calcul exampl in the annex must also match the word .
there is one other thing we should not forget .
capit requir regul have an impact on the real economi .
it will not be that easi to put an end to this .
the eu draft should draw a lesson from this .
the factor determin the bonus must definit be transpar .
transpar is the key to all of this .
this includ , mr canfin , decis on rule relat to remuner .
they must appli to all invest bank firm .
mr christensen , you stress the need for transpar .
capitalis is inde import .
we need to achiev exact the same object .
they have been set by the g20 .
it can not be the end of the stori .
it is clear that there is still work to be done .
the role of the sharehold must also be strengthen .
the debat is close .
question time ( commiss )
the next item is question time ( b7-0316/2010 ) .
the follow question are address to the commiss .
the answer is yes ' .
let me describ an actual case .
the involv of industri wa of two kind .
perhap it would be help if i outlin how that wa .
( pl ) thank you , mr šemeta , for your answer .
unfortun , i do not find it satisfactori .

thank you for your attent .
these anim have suffer prematur age or other diseas .
clone anim suffer .
most clone organ have not surviv or have die prematur .
the success rate is one viabl organ in 75 clone attempt .
it is a serious ethic issu .
we must guarante that it is safe .
first , the legisl must have a scientif basi .
the citizen of europ have a right to demand that .
this is at complet odd with innov and develop .
meat from clone anim is definit not a priori harm .
howev , risk can not alway be exclud either .
there must be no clone anim in the food chain .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
we certain do not need meat from clone anim .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
( the presid cut off the speaker )
one ask oneself : whi should we ?
is there perhap a shortag of meat stock in europ ?

i am plea that we succeed in achiev this .
there ha to be a level play field .
the question is that we have now recast this legisl .
member state have got off the hook .
my member state , the unit kingdom , ha got off the hook .
it ha not done what germani did .
at the end of the day , that is what this is all about .
at the end of the day , howev , we are make progress .
we have reach , in the end , what is an accept compromis .
member state are not particular happi .
certain some member of this hous are veri unhappi .
at the end of the day , that is alway the consum .
this commit ensur that this vari realiti will be observ .
unfortun , the electr market is not yet a singl market .
it will take time to achiev that object .
commission , you said it yourself .
this process is veri import .
of cours , it is a good compromis .
around 95 % of the polish energi sector is base on coal .
this is econom and technic problemat .
this should be made to appli onli to new invest .
it is base on dogmat principl .
( pl ) mr presid , i would like to comment on two matter .
i would like to congratul all of the negoti .
industri can now follow .
the upshot of all this ...
( the presid cut off the speaker )
flexibl is still possibl but must now be clear justifi .
the commiss can collect inform on the use of this flexibl .
that is what the compromis is bring .
the fact is that we are move .
it certain ha the support of the commiss .
a good omen , i think .
who exact it will be , we will see .
i do not want to express ani prefer now .

this also goe for the shadow rapporteur .
it ha been a pleasur work with her .
we would do well not to underestim the success there .
it follow on nice from what jan wa just say .
nice sound word are not enough .
good intent are not enough either .
no wonder illeg log fuel crimin in madagascar .
so what we are do today is a first step .
tomorrow , we will make a start .
it can be done , and here we have proof of it .
this is excel , this is good news and an import measur .
what doe that mean ?
this wa on the tabl at the begin of the debat .
therefor , we must be moder in this area and ensur balanc .
we have succeed in do this .
this is not onli applic to fell , and it will not work .
zero risk is not feasibl .
it produc bureaucraci and , abov all , produc new risk .
we must ensur that the law remain balanc and feasibl .
in this sen , this compromis is a good one .
we are sure all unanim on that issu .
that should not be the purpos at all .
that , too , is now someth to make u apprehens .
this is an import exampl of how we should not work .
we have quit a bit to do in this area in the futur .
howev , it is not a perfect solut .
there are option for bypass even this system .
howev , further measur are ...

i would like to thank the rapporteur .
a decent societi creat sensibl rule .
it is therefor necessari ...

whi is it still relev in the 21st centuri ?
that is the scale of the challeng .
yes , we still need intervent and privat aid to storag .
that ha alreadi been tri and it ha fail .
i think that food product is an import object of the cap .
of cours , we can simplifi cross-compli measur .
agricultur must be support in this evolut .
the issu of generat chang will be one of our concern .
we need the common european agricultur polici .

this is a good thing .
farmer are requir to produc more and more with le and le .
this is imposs without increas effici .

solv this problem is go to be difficult .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
the cap must continu to be base on it two pillar .
bulgarian and romanian will receiv a mere 40 % .

( the presid cut off the speaker )

if they are end , what will we replac them with ?
( the presid cut off the speaker )
( the presid cut off the speaker )
eighti per cent of aid is alloc to 20 % of farmer .

we will also be happi to have a solut that is fair to u .
i beg your indulg and thank you again for your understand .

howev , i do not wish to prolong the debat .
i therefor feel that we need a realist budget .
two pillar : absolut , i agre with that .
they need to meet the challeng of the europ 2020 strategi .
( applaus )
the debat is close .
written statement ( rule 149 )
decoupl is necessari to avoid overproduct .
these would reduc farmer ' loss aris from price fluctuat .
this is whi we must help improv cooper between farmer .
we thus provid for the possibl of a transit period .
this undermin the sen of solidar , equal and communiti .
thank you veri much .
the report is a good basi for further discus .
thank you for your attent .
in write . - ( de ) i thank the rapporteur .
in my opinion , this debat goe in the right direct .
the develop of rural area play an ever greater role .
direct payment signific affect the secur of food suppli .
the next item is the debat on :
i wa one of the author of the first oral question .
i do not know how this happen or whi this happen .
i am extrem unhappi about it .
can i come back to this in the debat ?
clear there wa not enough time this morn .
you saw the demand and you saw the problem .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
it is not the administr that organis debat .
the administr help the polit bodi organis debat .
i am go to take 30 second becaus i have two blank page .
i have ask five question of the commiss .
i do not intend to speak befor i hear the answer .
i will return at the end of the debat .
thank you veri much , mr mcguin .
i will grant you later the time that you have not use now .
by the same token , ear-tag rule were not enforc .
inde , it will have entir the opposit effect .
europ alreadi import 500 000 tonn of beef .
we can not accept this .
europ buy 38 million tonn of soya and feed for cattl .
author . - mr presid , i will tri and be brief .
i repres scotland , which ha extens beef product .
how mani tonn of beef ?
how much access ?
is there no tariff , or are there minimum tariff ?
can someon plea tell u what the mandat is ?
two other point .
i would like to hear some answer to these question .
we share a common histori and social valu with them .
agricultur is onli one part of this macro-agr .
it is an increas import partner for the eu .
that is someth quit differ .
beef import will increas by 70 % , poultri import by 25 % .
our agricultur is in great difficulti .
destabilis it further will have serious consequ .
the commiss must hear this messag and this demand .
my group and i share these concern .
that is whi an impact ass is absolut essenti .
clear there is a lack of consist here .
it will depend on the firm of our negoti .
this is not scaremong .
i should like to emphasis one point in particular .
i am actual grate that the commiss ha reopen negoti .
europ is certain not close off to extern trade .
it ha not been good .
let me offer just one exampl in this regard .
mani activ ingredi are prohibit in europ .
you are not tell the truth !
this is the truth , mr de gucht .
this is the other reason for my question .
they should sort it out themselv .
there is no need to provid an eu framework for this .
the world ha chang over the past 11 year .
the european commiss ha disregard these develop .
it ha not request a new mandat .
go back to the draw board .
we have fail to defend them in the past .
there is no consist between agricultur and trade polici .
this parliament ha to insist that there will be .
where , i ask , is the consist ?
that is whi i am extrem concern .
i come from ireland , and we export 90 % of our beef .
how is europ go to provid for these peopl ?
we must end these talk and look after our farmer .
we do not want clone meat from the mercosur countri .
in trade , the key element is confid .
mercosur wa almost dissolv at the 2007 summit .
the countri do not agre on access .
venezuela almost did not acced .
how can we negoti in such a polit unstabl area ?
i think this is an outrag .
plea tell u when you are go to ignor peopl .
today i took eight speaker .
so i think i have done the maximum i could have done .
first of all on the mandat .
that is still true .
that is not the reason to chang the mandat .
the council doe not have to instruct u .
we are not instruct by the council .
we will stick to that .
i am readi to discus at length ani of the element .
our messag wa veri strong and veri clear .
we will insist that we have this meet a soon a possibl .
on sugar :
a for plant health , environment and other measur ...
we will do that .
the joint debat is close .
written statement ( rule 149 )
this attitud , i find , is appal .
two commission for one report , what an honour !
let u return to the report itself .
in essenc , we are demand the follow .
inde , we are on the eve of an import reform of the cfp .
so here we need an answer .
we need to work togeth with a global and integr vision .
this bring u to label .
consum want to know more about the seafood they buy .
final , a word on aquacultur .
i will be veri honest with you on this point .
howev , we must be clear .
this should not need to be the case .
the first is the iuu regul .
that is a first step , but it doe not go far enough .
we must continu to pursu this .
europ need fish .
europ can not have it both way .
is it your respons to prevent this ?
it would not happen in ani other parliament in the world .

the new version is an improv on the last one .
these are serious infring of fundament right .
i therefor still reject this swift agreement .
i vote against this report .
terror is a threat and a such must be combat .
even the rapporteur admit that he is not total satisfi .

( applaus )
world day against the death penalti ( debat )
we would first like to ask for your moral support .
what doe this mean in practic ?
this is a shame , becaus the debat is veri import .
there is still a long way to go .
therefor , it practic is even more contest .
the eu need to be somewhat more sophist in it approach .
last year , at least 714 peopl were execut by state .
so , whilst we have this debat , it is a veri person one .
we should concentr on address those case a well .
the death penalti is therefor a crime in itself .
it is often more than that , howev .
so far , europ ha onli preach .
the debat is close .
the vote will take place on thursday , 7 octob 2010 .
written statement ( rule 149 )
the realiti of this situat should give u food for thought .
it is most regrett that it is still in use in 43 countri .
it can not be regard a proper justic in ani circumst .
thank you .
current , 43 countri use the death penalti .
most death sentenc are carri out in china , iran and iraq .
howev , the statist tell a differ stori .
there , execut still remain a state secret .
this is horrifi , but true .
therefor , it is import that we act at global level .
eu action on oil explor and extract in europ ( debat )
i believ we are in agreement on that .
oil drill take place in these european water .
deep-sea drill especi repres a particular risk .
there are problem here that are beyond our control .
i am also address our neighbour countri here .
we need answer to this too .
that would at least address the problem adequ .
i imagin that new resourc would be need for this .
that is alway a problem , of cours .
i would also like to mention liabil for such major event .
what , in fact , is the insur situat ?
what possibl are there for get the fund need ?
how will they manag ?
how can they insur themselv ?
do we need solidar fund ?
there is much we do not know about the high sea .
after all , the human factor can also play a major role .
commission , you have overal respons for energi .
offshor oil ha it problem ; offshor wind would be better .
we are in the process of finalis a communic .
mr leinen indirect refer to libya .
we are talk about oil , and also about gas .
then there is the matter of regular check .
overal , then , plea give u two week .
we are on track to meet the object of our communic .
that should remain in the back of our mind .
a i mention , howev , secur must take preced .
i see three area in which we can act here .
the second is the financi framework .
a third area is emerg manag within the eu .
what do i mean by anticip ' ?
first , to have suitabl , prevent legisl .
no such legisl yet exist .
it took five month for the leak to be stop for good .
that is whi we are hold this debat .
that is whi we are take action .
our resolut is much in line with this .
these propos , of which there are mani , are import .
there is no question about that .
that is an overreact .
this is one of our great export earner .
we said we would control them , not wipe them out .
deepwat is mere a symptom of peak oil .
i consid that to be absolut unaccept .
who care ?
this is absolut unaccept .
ladi and gentleman , this is no way to go about thing .
i am grate for be allow to take the floor .
here at least , one can still speak .
my committe wa not involv in the resolut at all .
it wa a warn both for the unit state and for europ .
howev , there wa one warn we overlook .
no one had this inform .
after all , this is urgent need .
there are two veri import element a far a i am concern .
the first is the control .
sever of my fellow member have spoken about this .
these control are essenti .
whi is liabil so import ?
such thing are not regul proper .
it is not an overreact ; it is a veri calm reaction .
in 32 case , oper of these instal wa halt .
i hope parliament will think twice about go a far a that .
we all know that prevent is the most import thing .
she is right about that .
( sl ) the disast in the gulf of mexico is terrifi .
abov all , we must also take action outsid our own border .
and how should we prevent similar accid ?
the posse of valid certif is a key requir .
i think a few point spring to mind .
also , we need a disast manag fund .
this ha been mention and i agre with it .
madam presid , disast like this should make u think .
i hope that will happen in respect to the arctic area .
alarm bell are ring and they can not be ignor .
it is obvious that the sacrific is not worth it .
i feel that to do this , three thing are absolut essenti .
we support this too .
let u not be under ani illus , howev .
this is even more true at a global level .
this is high instruct .
i wish to make three point .
the second point : can a moratorium be justifi ?
clear , it is difficult to answer that question direct .
the debat is close .
the vote will take place on thursday , 7 octob 2010 .
written statement ( rule 149 )
deep-sea drill licenc must be tight control .
i welcom the view put forward by my colleagu , jo leinen .
the lesson is obvious .
thank you .
τhe next item is the joint debat on the follow report :
one of these , quit right , is biodivers .
i should also like to mention a few figur .
access to educ is rapid improv .
access to drink water is increas .
access to energi is increas .
there is near univers access to electr in north africa .
within this goal , there are sever sub-target .
i hope so , at least - we shall see on 14 octob .
that must chang , a we lead the world on these issu .
we need a 360 degre awar of what this mean .
that is realiti .
we simpli can not surviv without it .
we need much more pressur .
so let u speak clear and practic .
that is about the size of the new york stock exchang .
it ha cost cad 2 billion in replac cost .
marin life is in a poor state .
the baltic sea ha a histor high level of pollut .
howev , we must not make unrealist demand here .
biodivers is best serv by remain realist .
( de ) madam presid , let me begin with a detail .
mr deva also give figur in dollar .
the commission ha mention some veri specif object .
that is alway the big challeng at these intern confer .
i also believ that money alon is not enough .
mani of my fellow member have call for addit fund .
a you know , my pet subject is water .
let u see what shape the propos take then .
yet the council is silent .
the same thing appli to mani anim speci .
is it ever appli to offshor marin environ ?
let u be frank , you have not got a clue .
madam presid , let u put a few fact in order .
peopl constant say that the polar bear popul ha fallen .
it should be done in nation state .
this region 's biodivers is extrem rich .
it is home to 2 000 plant speci and 5 000 anim speci .
is this a question of money or of respons ?
i would say both .
how can we be more respons ?
model are in place .
those are just a few exampl .
howev , there could still be certain prevent instrument .
he also spoke posit about where improv have been made .
i should start by say that we should hide noth .
there are basic two line on which we should and can act .
whi a few ?
we have done quit a lot in europ up to now .
mani of you mention financ .
it is about environment harm subsidi .
it is also about privat financ .
i think it is extrem import that we understand that .
you know that there were two rio convent .
this is an import debat which lie ahead of u .
nagoya/cancún are pretti much connect stori .
so it is veri import that we achiev success there .
all your call for u to speak with one voic are well heard .
but have parliament firm behind u is realli help .
first and foremost , access and benefit share ( ab ) .
the debat is close .
the vote will take place on thursday , 7 octob 2010 .
written statement ( rule 149 )
i can give you more exampl .
homo sapien produc the most wast of all the biolog speci .
this is the basi for the present day declin in biodivers .
social provis of the lisbon treati ( debat )
this is a prioriti cross-cut object of the belgian presid .
the eu 2020 growth strategi must be sustain and inclus .
the commiss is care consid these suggest .
it is alway import that we live up to citizen ' expect .
i regret the statement today by the commission .
the stakehold are not tell me that .
i have met dozen of them in the past six month .
that is an import piec of legisl .
the bankster are carri on a if noth had happen .
this need to be clear laid down in primari law .
i believ that this need to chang a soon a possibl .
allow me to make a few short remark .
that is the primari object of a social market economi .
articl 10 under titl ii cover anti-discrimin .
social progress is a lever for end the crisi .
what sort of social europ is that ?
where is the defenc and promot of public servic ?
( de ) mr presid , the polit goal are clear .
i sometim wonder if we speak to the same peopl .
for you , everyth is fine .
free and fair competit wa suppos to lower price .
i am french .
plea , what are you afraid of ?
howev , there are mani other issu .
i am open to take further step .
the commiss ha been call for that .
that is where the european year ha been help u a lot .
of cours , nobodi believ that this can be deliv overnight .
we have to improv our instrument .
this is all part of a process .
i would be doubt about establish a new fund .
nobodi is call for the privatis of social servic .
these are predomin member state compet .
the debat is close .
written statement ( rule 149 )
it seem to me that this is not mere a diplomat gift .
the commiss ha thorough monitor the step taken .
a i say , i am quot from an english translat .
we made this deal .
they must not now fail this promis .
we were readi when they were readi .
they alway know how to find a way .
we are talk about ordinari peopl from the balkan .
we are not talk about safeguard job or the right of resid .
the onli reserv i have over the report concern kosovo .
and right so .
therefor , i have no worri on our parliament 's score .
what i am worri about , howev , is the council of minist .
there are rumour that some countri are have doubt .
i hope that these rumour are unfound .
we would be seen to be appli doubl standard .
that the council doe not trust the commiss 's opinion .
where will that leav u then ?
the matter is quit simpl , in fact .
we hope that such opportun will realli be exploit .
we in the eu should also work toward this goal .
do we realis what we are discus ?
oppress of woman is good , drink alcohol is bad .
this is beyond me .
what a load of nonsens !
it is enough to drive you round the bend .
this visa waiver will onli make thing wors .
how profound sad !
i hope that you will be abl to do so , but do let u know .
that is all i can say on that score .
now , final , the door will open for them to get out .
the last thing we want is a black hole in europ .
( sl ) congratul tanja .
it is a fact ; it is the realiti .
kosovo also need to be includ in the visa liberalis regim .
it is hope that this process will be complet veri soon .
this will also guarante u a safer neighbourhood .
further challeng await u .
yet the eu also need to keep up it credibl and commit .
we have been monitor veri close .
all countri must be treat equal .
the benchmark are clear and are veri transpar .
the process ha been a transpar a possibl .
a few word on kosovo befor i end .
kosovo is not forgotten .
kosovo is , of cours , also a veri import partner in this .
kosovo is not readi .
we are work with them .
they need to do more .
the debat is close .
the vote will take place tomorrow a plan .
written statement ( rule 149 )
part of my famili origin from albania .
our role is to encourag them .
the right to visa-fre movement will help achiev this .
this idea need to be put paid to .
such agreement are requir for eu candid countri .
a stop must be put to the negoti at long last .
furthermor , we still do not have a definit of liquid .
from our point of view , there are five unresolv issu .
we will stay on the ball .
that is our road map .
the third point concern the leverag ratio .
this financi crisi ha shaken the world .
it ha taught u some lesson , which we must take on board .
the global prudenti rule were not suit to real-lif condit .
in my view , this agreement is good news .
howev , we will not stop there .
we must nevertheless remain realist .
it is a reason start posit for u to take .
i am fed up of it .
whi doe europ have to be the cry-babi of basel ?
it is not what is intend by basel iii .
the fact are clear .
g20 wa clear .
and if that mean more stringent rule , then so be it .
my final messag is direct for the bank .
it is time to realis , therefor , that the parti is over .
we can not continu to have the taxpay bail out bank .
let u releas it and use it .
let u not move away from that .
i would like to congratul mr kara veri warm .
it seem to me that this ha been lack hitherto .
the measur propos in this area should be welcom .
this give caus for concern .
rule and new law are not alway the answer .
let u not settl for good if we can achiev the best .
i believ that rigid and bureaucraci are alway lie in wait .
the u economi is main financ through the capit market .
then we would be score goal and not conced own goal .
this is the transatlant balanc .
we are perfect serious about make reform .
there are other tool which are also import .
a few moment ago , mr ludvigsson spoke about stress test .
these need to be carri out regular .
so this is our approach at the moment .
mr ford , we do inde need to protect taxpay .
mr lull ask a veri specif question .
mr klinz rais the issu of too big to fail ' .
i am go to prepar a consult aim at strengthen this regul .
there would not have been a debat today .
we also need to begin an offens here .
the debat is close .
the vote will take place tomorrow .
written statement ( rule 149 )
the submit report is draft in relat precis term .
the question is , how much are we will to pay for it ?
european compani reli on credit from the bank .
otherwis , there is a risk of harm the european economi .
commiss fine in antitrust case ( debat )
the version current in forc wa adopt just four year ago .
this save a great deal of time and resourc for all parti .
fine , therefor , honour member , are our primari tool .
a number of member state actual authoris such sanction .
is there a need for a formal legal framework ?
in fact , it is quit the opposit .
dare i say , there may be some doubt about this .
the system could , howev , be improv .
and so the answer wa that it had not been consid .
howev , i would like to draw your attent to two matter .
i think that we should not becom fixat on these figur .
skew the rule of competit is not right .
i would like to make two brief point .
i am look forward to see them .
they still do it .
we may have to be invent about what we do .
madam presid , i will be brief .
i want to welcom what colleagu have said this even .
first , what can we do better in term of prevent ?
third , can we have a timescal for the prospect propos ?
is that a cartel ?
i would say that we should also have a fine : do both .
he is satisfi with the way that these guidelin are work .
this debat should be steer by two principl .
one point , mr lehn .
what is more , this system ha mani advantag .
there are possibl improv .
we can rais this issu through the complianc programm .
they are veri welcom .
the debat is close .
written statement ( rule 149 )
i welcom the swift respons from the european execut .
the commiss play the dual role of prosecutor and judg .
one-minut speech on matter of polit import
onli one ha been bar .
obvious , we can expect noth .
( lt ) the eu-china summit is take place today in brussel .
the ninth round of dialogu took place last novemb .
this rabbl effect terroris independ televis station .
how about the need to rebuild our economi ?
noth could be further from the truth .
let me say that again : over 50 % .
this item is now close .
allow me to digress a littl .
it is that set of problem to which the report refer .
the level of health care in sub-saharan africa is deplor .
i find that situat quit simpli unaccept .
we shall be return to this subject in due cours .

we apologis for the slight delay caus by the traffic .
the first reason is to arriv on time .
the second is becaus it is healthi .
the third is that it caus le pollut .
so , let u all walk to parliament !
sustain and competit invest pattern will be crucial .
it must not mere be a financi tool for invest .
it must better exploit territori cooper potenti .
the keyword must be focus and flexibl .
we have a stabil and growth pact .
thank you veri much for that .
these new , difficult , time call for a new polici .
what doe this come down to ?
object 2 must be retain , becaus it is veri clear .
final , allow me to add that we must improv thing .
that is attain and would lead to better result .
it is an express of major european solidar .
no region in the european union is shove to one side .
that would result in a veri differ pictur .
we therefor need to stop it .
one key interest is econom , social and territori cohes .
therefor , the onli ration criterion is the level of gdp .
we believ that to be absolut essenti .
i would like to highlight one other problem .
what transit measur are be propos ?
this text is respons , concret and open door to the futur .
it legitimaci is not in doubt .
cohes also includ econom and social cohes .
we must reject ani attempt at renationalis .
not all of these region are homogen .
we all know that this ha not been the case .
we can not forc peopl to accept it .
whi is this ?
that give an indic of the prioriti in the treati .
that give u our framework .
perhap we can begin to get it right this time .
the threshold of 75 % of gdp will natur be renew in 2014 .
i would like to focus on the promot of europ 's diver .
we are not talk about large-scal project .
we are talk about small project and more flexibl adjust .
is there not an absurd , a paradox in your econom polici ?
this is , and must remain , the pillar of european integr .
mr presid , the resolut is strateg veri well written .
we must support it .
howev , we have to find where the problem are at present .
17 member state are at le than 18 % .
the commiss ha to clarifi the situat .
the overal absorpt rate is 17.95 % .
for some of them , the figur is three time le .
if it can not , there is no sen talk about a bright futur .
thank you .
( de ) mr presid , we are not talk about peanut here .
it ha a wide rang of target group .
what will happen after 2013 ?
howev , i am oppos to a separ legal framework for the esf .
this is visibl and recognis .
( ga ) thank you , mr presid .
i would like to say a few word about cohes polici .
this is for two reason .
the first is to make sure there is a second chanc .
this is what we call skill mismatch ' .
citi are an import drive forc behind develop in europ .
this is whi i have a particular question for mr hahn .
is this still the case ?
if so , what percentag were you think of ?
this is whi it is part of the eu 2020 strategi .
let u give thought to how to improv and strengthen it .
that is whi it is vital import to avoid certain risk .
we expect the commiss to take action along these line .
unemploy rate across the european union have shot up .
the europ 2020 strategi is show u which way to go .
it seem that we all agre on this .
mr presid , joined-up polici are essenti to achiev result .
it would be a grave mistak to split up this cohes polici .
it would be the equival of break up the european union .
mr presid , wale ha benefit huge from structur fund .
that is a veri import issu for u to discus .
that is not the way to build the futur .
we are also go to continu with this object until 2020 .
( ga ) i do not have much time , mr presid .
therefor , i will focus on just a few point .
we need more , not le , europ .
this is ridicul and must stop .
i think that is import .
we have to take account of the posit experi of the region .
today , one third of european do not have vocat qualif .
mr presid , we are talk about cohes and region polici .
so there are link between all of our polici .
in each of them , we want an adequ fund polici framework .
i have a few point in relat to the resolut .
we also need coher in member state .
i support this resolut .
it fill me with enorm optim .
i am interced in order to ensur that it is not forgotten .
mr presid , this ha been a veri live and commit debat .
i would like to thank everyon involv .
we veri much support the call for a simplif of the rule .
the debat is close .
the vote will take place short .
written statement ( rule 149 )
at the moment , the road and rail link do not meet expect .
that is unaccept .
cohes requir solidar between all region .
it ha to adapt to the crisi .
unemploy ha risen in europ .
the major of public worker are woman .
the cohes polici is vital to the european integr process .
i should like to say a few word .
the cohes polici ha it support , but also it critic .
i am grate to mr hübner for her respons work .
by contrast , poland , for exampl , consist of 16 region .
i am prepar to play an activ part in such a review .

howev , the fund still ha to prove it worth .
the main drawback is the necessari mobilis of the fund .
on averag it take 294 day to approv applic .
the fund 's money is also distribut uneven .
the european globalis adjust fund is one such mechan .

i believ this to be particular import .
this is the reason for my vote .

i therefor vote in favour of adopt this resolut .
i fulli support this resolut of the european parliament .
we must identifi the name of the respons un command .
all we can do is describ them , one by one .
all this took place in the vicin of a un camp .
these atroc have long been ravag the countri .
it is terribl .
we , the intern communiti , have fail .
it should not be this way .
this made me decid to vote in favour of it adopt .
this is the reason for my vote .
it is a fight fought by all humanist .
noth justifi relativis the valu of human life .
more than 330 000 peopl in latvia remain without status .
the death penalti is the most inhuman and savag punish .
howev , everi precaut must be taken .
that is the onli real polit issu of today 's vote .
the commiss itself acknowledg this dure the consult .
in write . - ( lt ) i agre with this resolut .
it is like that public sector support will be insuffici .
we need to understand and support these issu .

invest in the preserv of biodivers will pay dividend .
i therefor vote strong in favour of this resolut .
moreov , global standard on liquid manag are propos .

health is not a commod .
the main caus are haemorrhag , infect and hypertens crise .
it is a disgrac to u in the develop world .
aid target at make health care access is need .
i therefor vote against the report .
cohes polici should be neither nation nor region .
it should be european .
it must be a simplifi and transpar polici .
in write . - ( lt ) i support this resolut .
2013 is just around the corner .
it should therefor have been given greater emphasi .
eu support for cross-bord cooper must continu .
we need to pay more attent to peripher rural region .
cohes polici is the great pillar of european solidar .
in write . - ( lt ) i agre with this resolut .
howev , support from the structur fund alon is insuffici .
the oper programm are focus on two area .
some adjust could be envisag .
we need much more than esf fund , howev .
we need to chang polici .
this programm ha a total budget of eur 1.36 billion .
this is the era of globalis .
what impact doe all this talk realli have ?

to that extent , then , we can be veri satisfi .
howev , we resolv this , too .

the terrorist were also kill .
our sympathi goe out to the famili .
i apologis for the interrupt .
i will make an offici statement on this matter .
the negoti on this file have not alway been easi .

the new bodi obvious need a budget .
that is necessari , and i take the promis serious .
we will certain press for these thing to be implement .
i see no contradict here .
with the unit state , we need to negoti on equal term .
the eu 's strength is diver .
the european parliament ha a fine motto : unit in diver .
these are word that carri oblig and they have a deep mean .
i wholeheart wish baro ashton success in this import work .
we have save the communiti method and develop prioriti .
we have enhanc democrat scrutini , especi on cfsp line .
what is the ad valu of the european extern action servic ?
i think the game is still open .
i still want to see the structur in place to achiev that .
that can be an ad valu provid by the european union .
along these line , do we need more deputi ambassador ?
or will it not be your role , mr ashton , to send an sm ?
we are live in the 21st centuri .
the role of former diplomat belong in the 19th centuri .
creat a mediat cell , for exampl .
gender equal doe not end with staf prioriti .
i think that will bring u all forward .
the discharg of the council remain on our agenda .
this lead me to the proport of woman repres .
they do exist .
howev , what would he have been without a big band ?
the govern did not do this ; we did their job for them .
this instrument must also be observ by u .
i believ most of u can agre on these principl .
the devil is , howev , in the detail .
nevertheless , i should like to congratul the rapporteur .
final , member state are make deep cut in public spend .

written statement ( rule 149 )
it is in our common interest to make the eea oper in 2011 .
howev , this support doe not equat to give cart blanch .
this criterion and compet are not mutual exclus .
it is not a good idea to widen them .
and that is in everybodi 's interest .
where are we now , five year befor the 2015 deadlin ?
encourag progress ha been achiev .
this is part of our european project .
develop aid must be conceiv a a catalyst , not a a cure .
no countri ha ever been transform by aid alon .
the commiss therefor welcom this report .
the recent econom crisi ha result in a rise in unemploy .
that is whi poverti reduct featur in the treati of lisbon .
poverti reduct must remain the eu 's prioriti .
that is whi i urg you to reject amend 1 and 2 .
the number of billionair is increas .
the lisbon strategi ha fail in it mission to erad poverti .
we can no longer stand by idl and let thing happen .
now is no longer the time for meaningless rhetor .
the time ha come to be bold and show some polit courag .
poverti , end poverti , this should not be just a slogan .
we need to revisit this .
we do this ourselv through our polit method .
one of your answer is to introduc a minimum incom .
a pan-eu minimum wage would distort the issu .
the focus must therefor be on relief in relat to work .
work must becom worthwhil again for eu citizen .
it ha the biggest gap between live standard in the world .
our job then is to reduc these differ .
we must also help the rural communiti combat poverti .
and so i urg you , the fight against poverti ...

written statement ( rule 149 )
unfortun , this percentag ha most like increas .
everi six second , a child die of hunger on earth .
there are sever million undernourish child in europ .
employ is the benchmark in reduc poverti .
it is the onli way of give back digniti to everyon .
europ can not cure all ill .
abov all , member state must face up to their respons .
in this regard , poverti still ha a feminin face in europ .
the disadvantag situat of woman is structur .
is this not profound unfair ?
the minimum incom , howev , vari by near 50 % .
despit these shortcom , this report is certain inform .
it is activ that must be increas and encourag at ani cost .
this , too , is a self-perpetu stigma , which is unten .
poverti , therefor , main threaten young peopl .
it is veri difficult for someon finish educ to find a job .
i am therefor appeal to the repres of the eu .
the latest statist are frighten .
in poland , that is about 6.5 million peopl .

it is enough to lose your job or becom serious ill .
equal import are social and ethic issu .

we are veri plea about this progress .
the unit nation and the european union are natur partner .
that work must deepen and grow .
we are confront mani challeng and multipl crise .
no nation , no group , no region can do it alon .
if we share in the burden , we will share in the benefit .
everywher , we see current of concern .
these are test time , even in a prosper region like europ .
i believ we can pas the test .
we have mobilis global support for common action .
let me be specif . first , the poverti challeng .
yet our achiev are uneven .
obstacl stand in the way .
near one billion peopl go to bed hungri everi night .
we will boost resourc and account .
we must focus on employment-centr growth - decent work .
this is the most stubborn of the millennium develop goal .
our second great challeng is climat chang .
here , too , europ 's vision and voic have been central .
neither should we avert our eye from what is plain to see .
there is no time to wast .
we have also to generat usd 100 billion annual by 2020 .
this wa a promis by the develop world made in copenhagen .
europ ha been a histor engin of growth and chang .
you can keep u move in the right direct .
today , there is new momentum in fulfil disarma commit .

some play on peopl 's fear .
they seek to invok liber valu for illiber caus .
they accus immigr of violat european valu .

written explan of vote
current , 18 member state voluntarili collect that data .

such data are essenti not onli for statist purpos .
the greens/efa have vote in favour of the propos .
we have noth to lose .
current , there are 180 000 unemploy peopl in latvia .
in 2010 , anoth 500 worker are expect to be made redund .
a sum of eur 832 000 wa mobilis on that occas .
the aim of the propos is to bring union legisl up to date .
this report is head in that direct .
i vote with this in mind .
i am therefor vote in favour .
it is also import to prevent the cost becom excess .
i vote with this in mind .

social protect is an essenti part of flexicur .
the most import posit propos in the report are a follow :
woman hold precari job much more often than men .
this cycl need to be revers .
in this respect , mr thomsen 's initi is veri time .
continu to support import poverti is not the solut .
to reinforc this develop is the wrong way to go .

( 12699/2010 - c7-0202/2010 - ; and
( 13472/2010 - c7-0263/2010 - .
this , then , is what 2011 is like .
we no longer have two chanc .
i repeat : we no longer have two read .
appar , they are to be financ from current resourc .
the same concern programm relat to research and innov .
i think it is excess at this point in time .
the question is where it should come from .
we all know that the european union is underfinanc .
the fund requir to perform task should be increas .
in our view , it will be imposs to function like this .
thank you for your attent .
i heard the end of the commission 's speech .
i have also been brief on the rapporteur 's speech .
obvious , this call for strict control over expenditur .
propos will be made in the forthcom discus .
it will listen to the propos and will form an opinion .
mr presid , honour member , i thank you for your attent .
this is an import issu .
we need the resourc .
i hope the commiss is right in it optim on dairi market .
i am concern about volatil .
we want to get more adult into eu-fund further train .
we would appreci the council 's support for this .
i will make four point .
eu budget money is direct to our futur invest .
i call on my colleagu to approv the draft budget .
first , the financ of agenc .
mr presid , thank you for the floor .
what do they solv with these fund ?
sure not the crisi .
mr presid , minist , it is not worth it .
member state should not play with two contradictori solut .
thank you for your attent .
that is where the biggest cut are be made .
whi is no speaker design here ?
that is a good question , mr rübig .
in ani case , we will find out , mr rübig .
this is veri modest .
cut the budget will not benefit them .
we must not forget that .
first , then , we are be restrain .
that is someth that we should not forget either .
there must be an increas here .
it must not be allow to supersed everyth el .
i believ that this is absolut necessari .
so , should we not rein in the eu budget ?
we need to review the financi perspect up to 2013 .
otherwis , we will run into problem .
we are happi with the result .
we did not want eur 300 million for a dairi fund .
we vote wrong in this regard .
in ani case , an excel job ha been done - thank you .
we will see !
i think we should be care not to miss the point here .
i believ that that amend will be reject tomorrow .
iter 's budget ha been reduc by 45 million .
that is someth , at least .
this is the point from which i would like to begin .
in this debat , too , we need more european solidar .
this wa not an option .
the real rational at stake is , howev , this one .
europ is now desper .
portug and itali will also see strike next month .
this is simpli unaccept for the british peopl .
( applaus from the efd group )
you can not take this serious ani more ; yet it is happen .
it is onli the pvv .
therefor , we shall be vote against the 2011 budget .
we believ that is too quick , too soon and too much .
when extra spend is justifi , we should support it .
where spend is unnecessari , we should oppos it .
it is necessari .
we welcom some of the amend that have been approv .
parliament 's work is onli just begin .
first , we must make our new power work .
but there is a fundament misunderstand in this concept .
it doe not need to grow in order to perform it function .
we do have a lot of discret .
there is no need for an eu-wid tax .
the ecr say no to bond issuanc a well .
howev , an eu tax would be undesir .
i would like to comment on three point in particular .
we understand , minist , the posit of govern .
parliament call for this reform three year ago .
we found everi opportun to increas effici .
the outcom of this is what we propos .
we must not forget that there are limit to increas effici .
a reduct in resourc mean a reduct in polit ambit .
how can these object be achiev with the budget be reduc ?
when are we honest with european citizen ?
it is not an end in itself .
the european budget provid ad valu to taxpay .
these are issu on which we want clarif in the month ahead .
whi should it be ani differ this year ?
thus , from a polit point of view , it is an inflex tool .
we fleme are the champion among european taxpay .
this is inde where the balanc act lie .
that is someth that we will also have to work on .
we do not agre with this attitud .
howev , for now , they are in a minor .
the question is , how ?
let u be consist .
i think that is quit accept .
at present , it stand at around 1.9 % in the eu a a whole .
in my opinion , we must tri to take the follow action .
so i can speak a whatev .
the unanim agreement is there .
the show must go on .
unfortun , the council ha not done so .
the council , too , ha alreadi complain about this .
there is one more thing .
a far a the council is concern , that is not work out .
we have onc again creat a reserv for this .
there is also a reserv for this .
after all , europ must save too .
howev , the greatest disagr concern the figur , of cours .
this is the first budget follow the treati of lisbon .
parliament 's propos reflect this ambit .
everyon here clear agre that this is not possibl .
it budget is a budget which support invest .
( sk ) i am the head of a region author in my own countri .
these are the resourc we are look for .
the council ha so far fail to take a posit on this budget .
i am not say that to put the blame on you alon .
we await your propos in this regard .
all that should make u think .
the unit kingdom ha had a doubl dose of the bitter pill .
these are bill to be paid , a sort of legal oblig .
that mean that 94 % is deliv to the beneficiari .
head 1b ha often been mention .
we are go to have a discus on the budget review .
we understand , too , the council 's doubt .
it is worth take advantag of the opportun it repres .
i would like to add a polit messag , if i may .
it wa not by accid that we spent five year togeth .
thank you , commission !
enjoy your banana !
thank you for your comment .
the debat is close .
the vote will take place on wednesday .
written statement ( rule 149 )
howev , we are deal with parliament 's posit today .
we are , admit , in a recess .
budget review ( debat )
howev , it can not be separ from the polit goal .
this is a real achiev .
it took one year to mobilis money for the food aid facil .
the lesson therefor is that we need more flexibl .
it ha to be done .
let u take research and infrastructur a an exampl .
this is not enough .
own resourc is what make most sen at the end of the day .
( i am perhap take time from my final reflect . )
nation tax sovereignti is not at stake .
this is not a replac for the nation contribut .
it should be seen onli a the supplement .
i am look forward to cooper with the european parliament .
thank you for your attent .
member state must be readi to lift this gauntlet .
i beg you , the opportun is still there .
that is the question .
that is where the question of the budget come in .
there is a need for greater flexibl .
we are all doubtless in agreement that it is a necess .
we await your ambiti propos , commission .
this is unaccept and must not happen in futur .
second , the vital point of this text concern own resourc .
for that is the basi of the european union .
that is what happen .
nation contribut start becaus of the british rebat .
that is the realiti .
we must also do so for democrat reason .
that , in fact , is the realiti .
but let u look to the futur .
that is again , i think , veri import .
how can we make sure that their invest are also deliv ?
final , on own resourc .
i will believ that when i see it .
this can not continu to happen in the futur .
what is it not ? ' whi a budget review ? '
after all , this onli benefit vest interest .
of cours , we have unanim , and there lie a major problem .
this is what is complet miss .
so now i do not know what we are talk about , after all .
mid-term revis .
this ha also been cover by other befor me .
howev , i would like to ask a question here .
this is also for the council .
perhap it will get to them through the translat .
this work should involv brave reform .
the issu of own resourc wa rais here .
i know this is a difficult issu .
the issu of sovereignti is veri import .
thank you for your attent .
will we say yes ' or no ' to these ?
we should all take part in this debat .
yet the 2011 budget ha shown this to be unten .
this is inde unten .
fortun , the commiss is also advoc this .
this increas flexibl should appli from a soon a 2012 .
we must break through this contradict .
this is most definit to be commend .
it is a budget which doe not bring u into debt .
this valu should continu to be a guid principl .
mr presid , a review of budget is alway necessari .
it is good that we are think it out again here a well .
second , we need to stop score own goal .
we have an r & d target of 3 % .
they are notic unforthcom .
the resourc must be use more effici in mani area .
howev , ladi and gentleman , parliament ha a good memori .
we must take that more serious in futur .
howev , this strategi need fund .
of cours , i am advoc a bottom-up method , base on addit .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
i would like to touch on three of them , each in turn .
second , i would like to dwell on the principl involv .
the final matter relat to own resourc .
we read this in the text - it is written there plain .
for exampl , how can we balanc expenditur with incom ?
should we cut the first and increas the second ?
this is come late , realli late .
we do not need to agre intercontinent to avoid evas .
mr garriga and mr surján are disappoint about the figur .
we can not simpli make adjust just like that .
you are disappoint , but this is my repli .
a for agricultur , this is a balanc posit .
there is also a strong polit defenc .
thank you onc more for your comment .

how doe it ass the implement of the regul to date ?
which member state could serv a exampl of best practic ?
we are not satisfi with it .
this is encourag .
the other are not so easi .
i am sorri to say this , but it realli is delay .
two percent is a veri small amount .
( el ) thank you , commission , for your comprehens repli .
this is a general rule .
greec ha a special problem .

( the sit wa suspend at 20:30 and resum at 21:00 )
combat late payment in commerci transact ( debat )
we have achiev the goal .
whi wa it necessari to improv this direct ?
the legisl from 2000 wa non-bind and not veri effici .
we have strict rule .
it wa the council that pose the problem .
this is a problem that leav smes in extrem difficulti .
for payment delay should be the except and not the rule .
i would like to thank everyon for their cooper and attent .
we can be veri satisfi with the adopt of this legisl .
i includ in that both the council and the commiss .
i think this is what this direct will achiev .
no provis have been made to facilit this in the propos .
thank you veri much for your attent .
final , i would just like to mention one point .
this should creat greater liquid .
i also welcom the provis on posit name .
i think this is a good idea .
it reward good practic and creat incent .
let u not forget farmer .
the multipl have been win .
i think that it wa energi well expend .
sometim , it can lead to bankruptci .
farmer often do not receiv time payment for their produc .
this direct is sure to improv the liquid of compani .
in spain , it is 138 day , and in itali 128 .
fortun , this doe not relat to late payment by consum .
they are expo to the domin of buyer and larg chain store .
thank you for your attent .
we must now tackl the black sheep of the industri .
so we have broad agreement .
i would like to mention three more aspect .
i also see definit success on the horizon .
the debat is close .
written statement ( rule 149 )
i am disappoint that the 5 % penalti ha been remov .
a fix period of 30 day is propos a the payment period .
except are allow onli in special circumst .
this term may be extend to 60 day in specif case .
this sort of practic must be brought to an end .
sludg catastroph in hungari ( debat )
let me now turn to the eu respons .
it wa deploy immedi for a week in the affect area .
the govern wa inform of that .
yes , it ha no mean to handl such situat .
you have also refer to this earlier .
the tragic event in hungari is also a loss for europ .
that is wholli unaccept .
we need to help the peopl .
what happen there is dread .
that is imposs ; there ha to have been a mistak somewher .
did the hungarian author shoulder their respons ?
did they carri out suffici check ?
third , there is the issu of inspect .
environment inspect are vital import .
industri accid can and should be avoid .
that is whi i would like to ask a few question .
plea forward it to mr buzek .
i would like this case to be proper investig .
he wa fine and had to go through disciplinari action .
the bureau take note of your complaint .
howev , back to the matter at hand .
allow me to quot a research in biogeometri :
all of them would have been avoid .
govern regul and supervis are need here . '
( sv ) what doe the commission think about this ?
what should be done and how quick can we do it ?
there is no good explan for this .
what do you mean by it ?
is this realli enough ?
these techniqu includ , for exampl , two protect wall .
there wa onli one protect wall .
then there are the inspect .
those inspect were inadequ .
howev , that must not mean that we leav everyth a it is .
it wa establish in 2002 when the flood happen .
that must not be the result of this .
that is not the purpos of the solidar fund .
howev , i would like to make a suggest .
the commiss ought to follow this recommend .
( nl ) i shall now switch to dutch .
wast must be recycl or reus .
europ 's environment and raw materi plan are veri ambiti .
in addit , there is supervis of mainten .
we need inform provid by independ investig .
that is anoth way of encourag busi owner to oper safe .
we must record danger materi .
parliament ha taken a stand in this chamber on these issu .
i absolut agre with what you said about the solidar fund .
one exampl of such legisl is that relat to liabil .
you gave a good coverag of all the issu that we are face .
befor i get into answer , just let me say the follow .
let me tri to respond to them .
that again would be work we will follow up veri thorough .
the second set of question concern financ .
what can we do ?
we also had quit differ view on the solidar fund .
i would say two thing here .
let me make this veri clear .
the inspect and the monitor are a member state respons .
we do not have a mandat in the commiss to do it .
there have been question relat to the recycl of red sludg .
of cours , it is terribl that the disast happen in 2010 .
there are three thing i would like to say .
the debat is close .
written statement ( rule 149 )
we can learn an import lesson from the incid in hungari .
we know there are mani more such reservoir in hungari .
howev , that is not all .
the next item is the debat on :
good even madam presid , commission .
what ha happen to those enquiri ?
have you receiv a respons ?
if you want someth , you go straight for your goal .
i wish you would be a determin in this particular case .
whi doe the commiss not start it own investig ?
we have ask for this befor .
you know that a major in this hous is behind you .
do we have proof that they exist or do not exist ?
do we have a list ?
they probabl did it with good intent .
if it is legal , we do not need a debat .
if it is illeg , we need to start infring procedur .
it is that simpl .
the commiss doe not hesit in other area .
in this case , i think that the commiss should act .
citizen are watch u .
that is the normal way we proceed with all member state .
now , what ha happen ?
well , franc ha given an answer .
let historian one day look at that .
now , object , what ha franc done ?
franc ha done exact what the commiss ha ask it to do .
well , we got it .
that is one thing that i think is some kind of a victori .
think about everyth which ha happen .
let u see if they do it .
i believ they are go to do it .
now we have got dossier on individu , sever pile of them .
so , a of today , we have these two case .
so someth ha happen .
you have seen cnil 's result .
i have read them too .
this might be the case onli for immigration-rel purpos .
the data protect author in franc is cnil .
what about the netherland ?
this databas ha sinc been delet .
i have one thing to say on the subject of the men file .
( the presid ask the speaker to conclud )
plea allow me to finish my remark .
( exclam )
your attitud is close to becom an unhealthi preoccup .
the answer to the other question is also veri import .
i doubt that great , commiss , and i am a historian .
i have mani doubt becaus even the journalist have doubt .
other newspap said that it would .
it will continu to be spoken of in this hous .
what evid doe the commiss need to take the matter further ?
yet the subject of today 's discus is discrimin .
they do not dare to leav their makeshift encamp .
their child no longer dare to attend school .
that is what the associ are tell u , commission .
that is the current situat of the rom in franc .
the men file .
let u drop the subject of the men file .
the gendarmeri ha announc that it ha been delet .
the cnil is a reput bodi .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
parliament did it job .
it is a risk which this institut can not afford to run .
we still maintain this posit .
the case is , therefor , still open .
i myself come from a countri with 500 000 citizen .
we do not want that to happen , so let u take action now .
the debat is close .
agenda for next sit : see minut
closur of the sit
open of the sit
mr presid , yesterday , we had a discus on the budget .
we check the issu .
thank you veri much for your support in this matter .
we will do what you want .
it is great .
the begin of today 's discus is fantast !
implement measur ( rule 88 ) : see minut
the next item is the joint debat on the follow :
this european council will have a busi agenda .
it focal point will , without doubt , be econom govern .
all these recommend can be implement quick through legisl .
clear , these are not easi issu , either technic or polit .
they will be discus at the european council next week .
the reason is veri simpl : relev .
all develop countri must contribut .
we believ this is a good basi for reach a compromis .
so , let no one blame europ if noth chang in this respect .
some other matter still need to be settl .
at this stage , the commiss will concentr on the substanc .
overal , i believ we are on track .
we have been learn lesson from the crisi .
this summit come at a critic time .
what do we want to achiev in seoul ?
imf reform , in particular , is overdu .
we need to keep up the momentum on the g20 a well .
i want the financi sector to play a part in this .
we need to move the intern process forward .
this is not easi .
we have come forward with europ 2020 .
we have propos a wide rang of financi market regul measur .
now we have shown that this is possibl .
our work is not yet complet .
mani thank for your attent .
we have to do someth about it .
these are , first and foremost , financi resourc .
that is our ambit .
( applaus )
some of these solut will be short- and other long-term .
we are essenti tabl eight recommend .
i feel oblig in these circumst to disown my opinion .
we would like it if this could be more than just a studi .
a you can imagin , that is quit an honour for our group .
i offer him my sincer congratul .
( applaus )
( applaus )
i call on presid van rompuy to heed this messag .
( applaus )
that is a dramat develop .
that is whi we insist on the financi transact tax .
there is a further worri develop .
( applaus )
that realli would open a pandora 's box .
normal , what we have to do is to ask for a convent .
let u be clear about that .
that is the third one on the tabl .
if you have enough support in the council , go for it .
fait vos jeux !
you can go for it .
i find this complet incomprehens , certain from germani .
it amount to a weaken of the bold propos of the commiss .
i have my own thought for you also .
do you all know the film jule et jim ' ?
well , there is a woman - mr merkel .
we know who jule is - it is mr sarkozi .
the troubl is who is jim ?
is it mr cameron or mr barroso ?
that is the dilemma for the commiss .
it is not enough to say 'i want ' .
my four-year-old son say 'i want ' .
howev , this presuppos that we have a european vision .
what is also need here is solidar , howev .
can you not see the danger that is threaten u today ?
and what an expens club it is becom .
this year , it is gbp 6 billion .
next year , it will be gbp 8 billion .
it will have quadrupl in the space of six year .
i hope it happen .
let u have a new treati .
you yourself seem to be almost support it .
thank you .
we are happi to go .
( de ) mr presid , i have a question for you , mr farag .
perhap you would be so kind a to answer it for u .
you are so concern about the british tax coffer .
it is our money !
( applaus )
( applaus )
in my view , what would that common posit be ?
we want to overcom the mistak of the past .
we did this in the case of supervis of the financi market .
we are do so with the report in respons to the crisi .
we need to move forward .
we need to find the answer .
the report by the five group send a clear messag .
we have not yet overcom the crisi .
the task forc and the deauvill rout have fail .
i would emphasis that these are onli propos .
it is the begin .
we are right at the veri begin of the legisl process .
that is a problem .
unfortun , the last few day have been a disappoint .
this caus u concern .
our messag is : leav mr rehn 's propos alon !
i will read the text in english :
of cours we do .
do you genuin support it ?
it is now time that you did so .
( applaus )
unfortun , there is scant refer to this in the report .
my second point , which is link to the first , is this .
thank you .
unfortun , that is not what is happen .
therefor , we urgent need an econom union .
i address those word to the council a well .
is the council prepar to accept that ?
the union budget is not enough .
there is no altern .
we need more communiti method and le intergovernment .
there is no free money and there are no short cut .
we made propos to improv the text .
we are continu to fund the bank .
they are still buy them .
and what is the ecb do while this is go on ?
it seem clear to me that this is a europ for banker .
mr merkel dare to say it and she wa shout down .
there must be some reason for that .
we need more current econom and financi polici .
to conclud , we need a commiss initi .
i congratul the commiss .
i also congratul the council .
what doe all this mean ?
that is someth that we want too .
howev , we then need to discus the substanc .
we want to make a differ .
that is what we are wait for .
this debat ha yet to take place .
that will be the decis thing for u .
this parliament will not have the wool pull over it eye .
this is not be discus at all .
it is a wage battl - a wage competit .
today , citizen are ask for the opposit : deed , not word .
parliament is on a par with the council .
we will be equal activ , but without concess .
growth and employ need their own initi .
specif propos are need on the european monetari fund .
stabl solut are need for sovereign debt .
other measur are need too .
there are mani question about what action to take now .
europ doe not exist in a vacuum .
today it is divid .
the common global good doe not exist .
by delay this reform , we are forego potenti influenc .
guy verhofstadt spoke just now about casino game .
i am tempt to add , no more bet ! '
the berè report conduct such an analysi , and it is excel .
this is extrem danger .
in europ , i think the crisi ha becom one of integr .
at the end of the day , howev , which of u is still great ?
this is what they want from u .
the committe ha now been extend by a further year .
in my view , this is quit correct .
the crisi is far from at an end .
what i can not understand is the strategi .
in other word : are we all follow the same approach ?
what have these solut been ?
so whi my indign ?
thank you for your attent .
i think that is one of the most import challeng .
that is also the aim for the european agenda .
there is no other way .
mr presid , one minut it shall be .
they have an opportun to make their case to the council .
i think our reaction should ultim be a posit one .
i think this is realli what we have to do now .
we have been promis improv econom govern in europ .
the rescu measur were posit , despit serious weak .
those are the currenc war and commod price volatil .
we must also deal with this problem at it sourc .
it is restrict , but we have no choic .
i should like to repli to two or three of those speech .
first , to mr zīle .
( applaus )
it is time to move from word to action .
this is our view .
so far , we have onli seen the begin .

written statement ( rule 149 )
this is a crisi that we are unabl to bring under control .
it is time for them to listen !
the econom recoveri is under way in europ .

this is lead to a social explos and comprehens injustic .
parliament face a major task .
thank you for your attent .

those who are absent are alway in the wrong .
we need the european extern action servic .
now we have to take care that this doe realli happen .
i am go to be watch the process veri care .
i wa one of the mep who abstain .
i have therefor vote against it .
a few issu have not yet been clear up suffici .
for these reason , we abstain from the vote on the report .
this wa made possibl by realloc budget fund .
this is the first budget follow the treati of lisbon .
parliament 's propos reflect this ambit .
i am refer in particular to romania .
do a i say , not a i do , seem to be offici eu polici .
i find that unaccept .
that is whi i vote against this budget .
it is for other to justifi whi they endors it .
thrive rural area are veri import .
i believ it is time to have done with all this .
that appli , abov all , to agricultur .
howev , i can not support tendenc to centralis .
abstain from vote is not a solut .

i am go to be watch the process veri care .
i did not feel abl to oppos this budget .
accord to the statist , the birth rate is fall in the eu .
woman is the futur of man , wrote loui aragon .
child are precious .
they must be protect .
so must their mother .
i regret the outcom of this vote .
freedom of choic is also a right for woman .
howev , support woman dure matern is essenti .
busi and social protect system are alreadi pay these cost .
i prefer the commiss 's propos of 18 week .
in write . - i vote in favour of this report .
this can be describ a both a quantit and qualit improv .
i vote in favour of matern leav last 20 week .
the posit of woman regard pay is alarm .
it must not be made ani weaker .
it is vital import to see that that doe not happen .
it ha been a long process .
nutrit is a key determin of health throughout life .
the vote on mr estrela 's report is vital import .
the posit adopt is pure demagog and irrespons .
i did so after lobbi from support and oppon .
it is a step to close the exist gender pay gap .
on averag , in the eu , woman earn 17 % le than men .
extend matern leav is one of the mean to that end .
for this reason , i support an extens to matern leav .
the risk of poverti for work peopl in this group is 24 % .
howev , i would ask some question of principl .
who is go to foot the bill for that ?
the direct ha yet to be accept by the council .
this is the case in everi european economi .
malta is a case in point .
i would like to congratul mr weiler on her outstand work .
i welcom the effect of this vote .
that would be good for our compani and good for job .
the econom crisi ha exacerb the situat of mani european .
the econom crisi ha made poverti consider wors .
two situat requir a differ approach .
is that gross averag incom or net averag incom ?
prioriti must be given to fight these caus .
poverti affect 85 million peopl in europ .
it is our job to secur a decent life for all citizen .
i am therefor vote in favour of this import report .
a minimum incom for citizen is a remedi , not a solut .
i vote in favour of mr figueiredo 's report .
work repres the greatest prioriti for the popul .
eighty-f million peopl are threaten with poverti in europ .
let u listen to them and act .
i am firm oppos to the report on those ground .
howev , that is not enough to combat unemploy .
simpli have work doe not offer protect from poverti .
this must chang .
the futur is part of fulfil the content of this initi .
europ need enterpris and le bureaucraci .
i have therefor vote against the report .
i have thus decid to vote in favour of this report .
howev , the european union must do more .
i vote to adopt this report for two reason .
it is now time for europ to get go again .
this is what the public expect .
it produc wealth found on hot air .
pretend to supervis it is not enough .
it must be chang .
we do not need le europ , we need more of it !
this report call for europ to be unanim on essenti issu .
therein lie the real crisi .
noth justifi a reduct in offici develop assist .
in the long term , they onli displac the under problem .
the crisi must absolut not be use to extend eu compet .
eurocraci and bureaucraci are no answer to the crisi .
i wa sad to vote against the berè report .
we are also experienc a huge crisi in public confid .
in write . - ( lt ) i vote for this report .
all this ha sown instabl and declin in europ .
adopt the euro wa a gambl of fundament import for the eu .
this is whi i vote in favour of adopt the document .
but it doe someth el .
it effect and credibl are at stake .
without rule or supervis , you can not make ani progress .
i am vote for the report for the reason given abov .
the recommend provid in this report are a good start .
correct to vote and vote intent : see minut
approv of the minut of the previous sit : see minut
τhe next item is the joint debat on the follow report :
despit this , the size of the fund is relat small .
what is the mid-term review of this instrument about ?
this is import to u , in other word .
the european court of justic ha rule in favour .
i found this to be a veri import point .
my final point concern the issu of deleg act .
we have alreadi discus this issu this morn .
kind do not interrupt the session with such point .
i now turn to the report .
we accept the request .
therefor , it role is of great import .
howev , this is onli one side of the coin .
on the other side is the polit signific of this matter .
that review conclud that the instrument are work well .
this will provid ampl scope for fund civil societi action .
now we come to the most debat issu .
let me be clear : we definit need to find a solut now .
we veri much welcom this invit .
i feel confid that we can find a solut if we act togeth .
unfortun , the commiss saw this a an interim solut .
we ask for your support for this .
this is work well .
now we have a stabil instrument for post-crisi develop .
there are current 36 civil conflict .
i am veri plea to support this .
this also mean robust support for civil societi build .
the lisbon treati ha to make the eu more coher and effici .
that is what is keep u busi here this afternoon .
that , too , is a veri import innov .
this clear show that we need a stronger posit .
we need the power to codecid on where the money goe .
european citizen are in favour of develop aid .
the thief say : in that case , i want my money !
the european commiss ha no money .
i also want to say a quick word about the deleg act .
we can do it without the consent of their respect govern .
mr presid , thank you for give me the floor .
you deceiv me there , ana .
for my part , i would like to make three brief observ .
this is central to the debat .
evid , selfish is king .
i must say that this is rather surpris .
i call on the commiss to do just that .
it is our duti .
worst of all , howev , is the brantner report .
this is , of cours , a misprint .
this money doe not grow on tree .
it is not hand out by a giant tooth fairi .
it is not the commiss 's money ; it is not mep ' money .
with this , of cours , also come an increas in respons .
europ and the eu should and must take the lead .
the eu must show the way .
in the unit nation , it is the eu that take up the cudgel .
this attitud is quit simpli not tenabl .
our applic form need to be simplifi .
final , the commiss must work to relax financi regul .
the eu is the world 's biggest donor of develop aid .
what can be done about this ?
the european union is , in fact , releas substanti fund .

it is use for a huge number of purpos .
this make the scale of the problem huge .

they would do well to backtrack .
now i use the word ask ' with some care .
ask is exact what the british prime minist ha had to do .
i rare agre with david martin but i do on this .
mani peopl 's livelihood have been destroy .
i do not think we can even imagin what that is like .
we all agre that we have to help .

that is a good thing , i feel .
is that realli major , durabl aid to pakistan ?
doe this ratio add up , too ?
are these figur correct ?
i am firm convinc that we have to help pakistan .

on the contrari , a lot of semi-finish product are includ .
so this is not immedi harm u .
i would even say the opposit .
a comment wa also rais concern cotton export .

thursday :
mr presid , i am not go to speak for veri long .
it ha alreadi been defer onc , befor the elect .
it is import to make clear our posit approach to ukrain .
we are practic the last to take a posit on this .
we should not bring about the loss of our own credibl .
if we speak out , they will listen and be awar .
if we do not speak out , they will note that a well .
of cours , everyon ha a right to chang their mind .
i recommend that we make our decis in novemb .

thank you for your attent .
how will we approach secur threat and terror ?
i look forward to the debat that will now ensu .

i believ that we must act joint to counter protection .
you refer to energi matter .
we have to acknowledg this fact clear .
howev , it need to be done in a coordin way .
it is a great prize worth a lot of effort .
we need to breath new life into the tec .
we hope that this is a step forward .
we shall see .
on the contrari .
all this must be seen in context .
i wish you good luck and everi success .
we are with you on this .
close cooper with our u partner is necessari and right .
that should appli to all other european countri .
some hope of that if we continu to embrac global .
it doe not mean , howev , that the opportun are not there .
it is simpli that the context is a littl bit more complic .
this is contradictori and undermin our credibl .
we call for an independ inquiri .
the unit state are our natur alli .
we hope that you can persuad it to think again on this .
time is of the essenc .
i hope that the forthcom lisbon summit will be a success .
moreov , the world is chang .
there is even talk of a post-western world .
we have mani interest , ideal and valu in common .
we will be stronger if we act in a coordin way .
unfortun , the commiss did so onli veri briefli .
who realli came here to talk about the summit ?
it is time for u , too , to take the situat in hand .
( pt ) the world is experienc some veri difficult time .
the unit state is one of europ 's key alli .
neither europ nor the u would allow this to happen .
i wish you good luck for your meet on 15 decemb .
can acta be ratifi by the unit state ?
thank you .
we need an effici tool to combat terror .
m rede , you have our support on this agreement .
this is not a zero-sum game .
we know , today , that this wa a vain hope .
we have to assert ourselv and have our voic heard .
this is all we can say at this moment in time .
we will also discus joint respons to econom challeng .
i believ the precis date is 29 novemb .
i absolut agre with what ha been said in this hous .

written statement ( rule 149 )

fourteen member state have ident agreement with the u .
ten member state have such agreement .
i will , of cours , keep you fulli inform about this .
the same appli to the forward of data to third countri .
we also have a problem within the european union .
that is a fact that we have to face up to .
the proport test is not a polit test ; it is a legal test .
that is a key issu .
there are some other thing which need clarif .
some of the member state are propos a sunset claus .
whi will we do so ?
howev , pnr must onli be a tool to combat terror .
what benefit will there be to u from their access to it ?
the case of swift wa a tell one .
yet we also know a lot about what not to do .
the second is reciproc .
i emphasis the word voluntarili ' .
well , we will see what happen .
a regard the need , madam presid , it is obvious .
develop happen , and polici and legisl follow later .
the debat is not about that .
i would will add to that the issu of reciproc .

would we actual suppli the name and data for this purpos ?
we have pnr agreement .
i believ we want absolut freedom from ethnic stigmatis .

written statement ( rule 149 )
there is one point on which i feel it is inadequ .
the ration of this is often dubious .
altern invest fund manag ( debat )

there then follow a dozen trialogu .
( applaus )
the direct also aim to increas protect for investor .

( applaus )
i can not split myself in two .

we work togeth in a thorough construct manner .
i would also like to thank mr bullmann and mr goebbel .
the european regul will be implement from 2013 .
the direct will impos more transpar on privat equiti fund .
these fund will be welcom to financ the real economi .
( applaus )
a a result , we no longer have a problem with it .
overal , therefor , we are veri plea with the propos .
unfortun , these rule remain incomplet .
we are in a better place there .
mr presid , i would like to make two comment .
the first is address to mr gauzè .
inde , i wa abl to go along with the decis .
in my view , the council ha miss an opportun here .
these thing have noth to do with one anoth .
howev , this is not the concern of parliament .
that wa undermin by the council .
i want to say this onc again ; this is passiv market .
this is a point that mr giegold ha alreadi mention .
it provid an open .
privat equiti were origin regul better .
they are now relat weak regul .
you can imagin what will come of this - not veri much .
will this regul prevent a further crisi ?
absolut not .
are we in a posit to afford such loss of busi ?
of cours not , but the eu doe not care .
but where is mr cameron in all this ?
do n't come to u to help reactiv the british economi !
we have been made helpless in the face of the lobbyist .
we need them and they are good for a strong economi .
we have , in that sen , better the legisl .
i will tell you whi .
this situat ha to chang .
that is an appeal from this parliament .
the text present today is satisfactori .
capit ha the abil to respond flexibl and is veri mobil .
congratul are therefor due to mr gauzè .
( lt ) thank you , mr presid .
we must learn from previous mistak and not repeat them .
it is not enough to talk about supervis and regul .
the european union must lead by exampl .
jean-paul ha given exampl of that good work .
that certain is hard work and hope it will pay off .
what is it all about ?
we will regist and authoris all fund .
we will establish a minimum capit requir of eur 125 000 .
this is a good result .
thank you , madam presid .
mr klinz spoke earlier about more transpar ' .
i think it will have quit the opposit effect .
mr hökmark ha stress the import of that industri .
instead of discrimin , we now have a set of simpl requir .
i think that is the right solut .
that is true .
so let me thank each and everi one of you .
( applaus )
sever speaker have also mention passiv market .
to conclud , i would like to make two point .

these were privat equiti fund and hedg fund .
the risk are associ specif with the first .
singl market act ( debat )
this is an import document .
what is europ do for u ?
it is not someth you can take or leav .
we now come to the third chapter of the singl market act .
it requir the help of everi singl communiti .
this is where the european parliament come in .
that is what we want to do .
we can not find this social claus .
a commit to carri out social impact ass could satisfi u .
we are call for collect redress .
studi have been carri out in this area for three year .
i believ we are not quit there yet .
let me give you two exampl ; first propos 29 .
but the problem for u aris when we read the text .
this ha been go on for 15 year now .
that is the real problem .
i believ we can achiev much more there .
so , mr barnier , i believ we have work to do .
we appreci that .
you got a flavour of some of the debat to come .
thus , no progress ha been made for consum .
what ha chang compar with the past ?
europ is no longer the europ of 1985 .
globalis repres an opportun for europ .
we must do more to tear down barrier .
that is the joint respons of all of u .
he gave a veri detail analysi of what europ could do .
we have to be clear-sight .
the singl market act is an histor initi .
this will requir partnership and share respons .
it is time for action .
we will work with you in the come month on this .
this is where the real ad valu of the eu lie .
it is a sea and the wind that enabl ani ship to sail .
he ha all our support .
first , and mr gebhardt mention it : collect redress .
we have been consult for 20 year .
anoth exampl relat to passeng .
when will we have it ?
we are wait for a framework direct .
what are we go to get ?
you say that there will be a communic and action .
the document is veri import and veri specif .
it is be said that this is our flagship programm .

that is the ambit .
mr harbour indic that this wa a new commit .
one thousand five hundr text !
mr harbour mention the growth of competit .
in fact , the opposit would be abnorm .
we will not abandon this issu .
these thing therefor go togeth .
we can not succeed on our own ; this is about work togeth .
it can still be improv .
the debat is close .
acquir experi should determin the futur .
the technolog exist , and so doe the need for it .
onli the initi is miss .
it must be use well .
this is a veri ambiti project .
is the commiss prepar to make the most of this momentum ?
busi a usual ' is the prevail watchword in the eu .
an exampl of this is the number of plan legal project .
the fact is , the singl market act is a revolut .
it is this commiss 's most tangibl work programm .
mani treasur are yet to be unearth .
whether this will succeed is primarili up to u politician .
so , let u get on with the work !
we trust that they will be implement .
the singl market can be made even more unifi .
this is the key to integr and sustain growth in europ .
it seem that here , it is not a topic worthi of attent .
innov partnership ( debat )
whi is this ?
there are plenti of question .
what exact are these innov partnership ?
more innov is need in this regard .
retreat behind the border is not an option .

in this regard , you have our support .
this is someth we must not do .
if that is the case , we will give it our full support .
this relat both to energi and to industri product .
i think that we are due some answer .
how are we go to support it ?
what will be the basi for it ?
the region dimens is also essenti to innov .
the human factor is at the heart of research and innov .
he could perhap be a littl more concis .
how will conflict interest be arbitr ?
how can account be ensur within a complex structur ?
what financi dimens will these partnership have ?
howev , the time ha now come for u to be more pragmat .
in the past , europ ha had a lead role in innov .
innov partnership should focus on this object a well .
there will be innov in time .
certain not .
that would run counter to our goal of simplif .

at the other end of the age scale are the young peopl .

thank you for your comment .
thursday :
no amend have been propos .
( the order of busi wa establish )
the next item is the joint debat on the follow :
perhap certain member could compli with that request .
howev , they constrain the capac of the govern to act .
in my view , this danger ha not yet been avert .
that is the current situat , howev .
the principl of the stabil and growth pact were infring .
this brought our main refinanc rate to 1 % .
these were , of cours , decis of extrem import .
to this end , we introduc our secur market programm .
in my view , three element are fundament .
there are two major topic .
i share this view entir .
the ecb use to say that this is no time for complac .
this is truer now than ever .
the challeng lie ahead of u are manifold .
anoth import challeng relat to financi regul .
we are face a decis year .
we will continu to deliv on our mandat .
this is what the treati requir from u .
an agreement had been reach to work on indic guidelin .
whi do i say that in this way today ?
of cours , that is not true .
we need to have some straight talk here .
you have not yet comment on these issu .
yet that could be precis the problem .
ireland show that this is not the case .
at the weekend , we saw onc again where that lead u .
i can not give an off-the-cuff answer to that right now .
yet ani realist know that this will not happen .
is the eurozon readi for estonia in januari ?
a singl currenc onli work in a tight-knit feder environ .
it ha alreadi pas .
perhap that is a good thing .
histori will show u whether it wa realli such a good idea .
just whi is so much pressur be pile on at present ?
is it my life assur with allianz ?
is it , in fact , the german bank , a is alway be claim ?
the leman brother solut can not alway be the answer .
the financi economi is global in natur .
the crisi , too , is global .
i onc again agre with the rapporteur .
govern debt is a serious problem .
what is more , the economi need to be reviv .
european solidar is be shown with difficulti and spare .
mr van rompuy spoke about the euro struggl to surviv .
he is wrong .
we have the most solvent intern market in the world .
we must work togeth to overcom our problem .
but these peopl are wrong and they live in the past .
it is about the world test u .
are we will and abl to act ?
final , a word about the auster measur .
fortun , mr balz 's report is veri clear on that point .
cutback are need if we are to overcom the crisi .
therefor , do not do it !
i have a veri specif question for you both .
it show that we were right - the euro can not work ' .
this is , of cours , an erron claim .
i will therefor ask you two gentleman a question .
gentleman , you need to explain this .
can i ask you to justifi this ?
but worst of all , they join the european singl currenc .
madam presid , mr batten is right .
but we are in a situat where we need solidar .
we are all veri much interlink : let u not forget that .
last , there is polit instabl this even in ireland .
we need to help ireland , not punish it .
we have alway support you in this .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
ireland is in difficulti .
these are tough and confus time .
this is our mandat .
otherwis we would have had a dramat crisi .
this wa in 2004 and 2005 .
so i have to remind all of you of that .
but again , our messag is veri clear on that .
we have , of cours , to perman improv our communic .
we tri to do that .
so we tri to be a account in term of communic a possibl .
now there were a number of veri import question .
if thing go wrong , it is europ 's fault .
this is the classic scapegoat phenomenon .
therefor , let u bewar of the scapegoat phenomenon .
( applaus )
thank you veri much for your detail answer , mr trichet .
the first is the independ of the european central bank .
the european central bank is the guardian of the euro .
this is a import point .
a far a i am concern , that is a veri import point .
final , mr trichet mention basel iii .
this is anoth thing that i would certain emphasis .
we want to implement basel iii prompt .
the joint debat is close .
the vote will take place tomorrow .
written statement ( rule 149 )
in write . - i welcom and support this report .
a a result , we have high and rise unemploy .
unemploy will rise , and our econom perform will stagnat .
this propos is simpl and is not controversi .
no obstacl appear to a speedi approv .
we must also consid the need to prevent and combat fraud .
it onli serv to prolong the agoni .
it is a recip for profligaci .
combat fraud and ea burden on smes are red herring .
we also want to see a more effect intern market .
today , we did not discus what solut are requir .
the debat is close .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 11:30 .

urgent aid to haiti ( debat )
but it is fear that these figur are sever underestim .
treat cholera patient also requir consider human resourc .
the whole countri is now affect .
anoth offer from austria ha just enter the pipelin .
the countri ha suffer numer disast for year .
haiti need a state which can do someth for it poor .
this is certain not an answer , but it is an explan .
the answer to this scourg must be twofold .
i have two question to the commiss .
this is not a terribl hard diseas to cure .
it wa an emerg .
the haitian popul feel quit helpless .
my question will therefor be simpl , commission :
the intern communiti can not delay ani longer .
i say this to all member of this hous .
the great tragedi is the earthquak .
the even greater tragedi now is this cholera epidem .
what a contradict !
now cholera is here .
they have all gone .
they sudden left .
whi did this happen ?
whi is the unit nation now be ask to disappear ?
when are they go to ask the eu to disappear ?
this is ridicul .
the outbreak of anoth epidem in haiti wa to be expect .
there is much ground to be cover .
we know that you will be present at everi emerg .
this truli wa a monument disast .
what is it then that they are reli on u to do ?
of cours , prevent and clean drink water are the prioriti .
all of these are in short suppli .
this is not an easi crisi to resolv .
so we will have to mobilis .
let me make four point .
the first is how we can best help .
the pledg made by the commiss ha been honour .
the haitian author prefer to stick to the timet .
it is difficult for me to give an answer .
my fourth point concern engag .
one member spoke about the haitian peopl be veri resili .
the debat is close .
τhe next item is the joint debat on the follow report :
we start work in septemb .
after month of work , we had stalem .
i ask the new presid whether it wa will to continu negoti .
they told me not to be impati , not to hurri .
final , the third amend refer to the review of catch .
is this true ?
i am ask you now , commission .
what do you intend to do ?
i would like an answer today .
i would like some clear answer on these issu .
we have been work for 14 month and all we have is confus .
strengthen your credibl in this sector !
you must respect them .
your action do not match up to 21st centuri leadership .
our guid principl have been transpar and particip .
plea adopt these principl .
this is how the european project must move forward .
i will give my reason for that .
the scientif advic is clear .
this is one stock which cover the entir geograph area .
we could not agre to the split of a singl fisheri stock .
but let u keep the polici a it is .
onc again , i would like to express my veri sincer thank .
it wa reopen in januari 2010 , just five year later .
we absolut need to prevent this happen again .
i can support these amend .
there is onli one except , howev .
so we have this margin .
the figur of 5 000 tonn is simpli not science-bas .
how ha it been decid upon ?
whi not 6 000 or 7 000 ?
we need to do that .
we have befor u the revis common fisheri polici .
moreov , peopl have short memori .
howev , caution won out against game of chanc in committe .
count fish is not difficult ; it is like count tree .
it is just that fish move around and they are not visibl .
we therefor need to have safeti margin .
there are also issu affect vessel in the north sea .
discard is not conserv , it is wast .
high grade is a respons to the unfair quota system .
reform the system and it will disappear .
specul must be end complet .
it is veri import that we make a distinct here .
this is the sector that ha suffer the greatest damag .
we fundament support the propos on three point :
it is essenti that articl 15a is includ in the regul .
that is not our aim .
i assum that you will be vote in favour tomorrow .
i consid that outrag .
i would like to congratul mr gallagh on his report .
we should strong oppos that .
this can be a win-win situat .
my group , the ppe group , ha a differ view .
this make an annual total upward of gbp 11.1 billion .
this plan is support by the sector , which need stabil .
the discus wa veri interest inde .
so we have to find a solut to unblock the situat .
these are veri import long manag plan .
we intend to produc such a polici .
we can not afford this ani more .
we can not throw fish back in the sea .
one last remark about the aquacultur problem .
i can agre with that .
the sector need a plan .
that is the sector that we have .
we have live for mani year with this lack of transpar .
i would , howev , like a clearer answer , commission .
i hope that common sen will prevail .
i will certain be recommend that we support that amend .
it deal with artisan fisheri and histor right .
thank you veri much .
the debat is close .
written statement ( rule 149 )
the next item is the joint debat on
it is not onli a question of willing to compromis .
there are point on which we do not agre .
i regret the absenc of the council .
we have succeed in reach agreement on this matter .
that is not someth that we want to encount .
patient are high interest in their own health and wellb .
again , i applaud parliament for take exact this stanc .
this is a veri import chang .

therefor , this argument is incorrect .
what will happen next ?
domest coal will be replac by import coal .
that is the onli thing that will happen .
europ is a leader in this area and ha an export advantag .
i do not believ that we should just give this up .
you can not oppos an ideolog with fact .
this is a veri complic and complex subject .
the cost have to be paid out of the public purs .
therefor , this argument also doe not hold water .
this is whi the 2018 propos is high sensibl .
the mine were subsidis in the vain hope of achiev profit .
articl 3 ( 1 ) of our propos mention this point .
state aid distort competit .

2011 budget ( debat )
the next item is the debat on the 2011 budget .
i would like to begin our discus .
agreement could have been reach .
the european parliament is awar of the need to make save .
this is import , becaus the treati of lisbon is in forc .
we did not want to go beyond the treati in ani way .
this is the respons of all three european institut .
i am sure that an agreement is within reach .
no , it is about ensur that europ can honour it commit .
what is that realiti ?
is this a way of reconcil our citizen with europ ?
i do not think so .
( applaus )
i may be wrong , but the suspicion is there .
it is not about money .
we have agre on the money .
if not money , then what is it all about ?
it is about the right of the european parliament .
it is about the right which are laid down in the treati .
i am rather surpris .
the 27 govern of the european union are execut .
therefor , this decis could set a preced .
parliament must not allow it right to be taken away .
what happen next ?
it is the eu 's money .
it must then be control by parliament within the union .
we have talk about this over the last few hour .
howev , we must not now give up this line .
the head of govern have the choic .
that is the unanim line taken by my group .
( applaus )
it act on behalf of nation , whose govern are elect .
mr presid , there are mani interpret , mr morvai .
that much is complet obvious .
here we are now five year later .
on the figur , let u be veri clear .
let u be veri clear on this .
what is more is that flexibl is an acqui ' .
own resourc is also not a question of new compet .
so i have one request to you mr barroso .
my request is veri simpl .
it is not just a budget .
after all , it is not complic !
my final comment concern ireland .
well , have you got it yet ?
it is cri mummi , mummi , europ , help u ! '
( the presid cut off the speaker )
i think the respons lie with both side .
that is how we can reach a compromis .
i think mr wathelet is work veri hard on this .
( repli to a blue card question under rule 149 ( 8 ) )
mr presid , europ is a polit bodi .
green also particip in this to make it wrong .
i know that .
i can say it clear .
the other who are respons are the european bank .
i repeat : it is a minimum standard .
the net contributor seem to have forgotten this .
in recent year , my group ha reject the eu budget .
( de ) mr presid , i have a question for mr biski .
that is a differ subject .
it ha to do with product , but in a quit differ sen .
but this , i fear , will never happen .
i have also heard it within the council .
there will alway be a way not to succeed .
this is the context in which we are work at the moment .
howev , we can make progress .
they deserv our full attent .
the european budget is differ from nation budget .
this tool is therefor too import to be jeopardis .
europ need the european union to have a budget .
it is a budget for the region of europ .
it is a budget for innov in europ .
it is a budget for the peopl of europ .
i must say that what ha been said repres a step backward .
it is le than what we have so far heard from the council .
i would like to thank you , mr barroso .
let u be patient .
this is a veri import discus .
we have alway achiev thing through cooper .
they must show what they are made of !
how will we achiev these task ?
how will we put our share ambit into practic ?
presid barroso 's speech this even wa good .
of cours we must have one .
we accept the 2.91 % increas in payment appropri .
it is a question of flexibl .
this issu of flexibl is a veri tangibl one .
we must , therefor , have flexibl .
the eu 's own resourc are to be reform again .
this wa laid down in 2006 in the interinstitut agreement .
all we want is for this to be confirm again .
if we do that , we will alreadi be admit defeat .
therefor , we must not give in at too earli a stage .
( fi ) mr presid , we realli have an excel situat now .
that is the situat we sought , and that is the truth .
now there is an opportun to grow .
noth come of a centralis polici .
the exercis will soon be over .
well done , i say .
not a bit of it .
we are talk about dutch taxpay ' money .
is this the end of the eu ?
by the way , mr schulz , befor you start , i am not blond .
no , it is not .
the engin of european develop is splutter .
so whi not ?
whi can we not deliber on this ?
so whi do we not creat a flexibl budget ?
this mean the end of the european spirit .
quit the contrari !
plea research for yourselv !
it can not go on like this ani longer !
it is not the council argu with parliament .
we do not accept that single-mind auster is the way out .
let u tri to avoid that .
i do not understand .
that is our red line .
plea , council , tri again .
everyon wa open the throttl .
this year it is the opposit .
everyon is now hit the brake , fine .
the treati of lisbon ha been in forc for one year now .
it confer on the union long-await new power .
the same is also true for the europ 2020 action programm .
mr presid , i would like to stress three thing .
i believ that we need a budget , one hundr percent .
there is no other solut .
i think that we will then make it a success .
mr presid , i welcom this debat on the budget today .
an eu tax is out of the question in my view .
howev , our effort are not over .
on the contrari , we should , now , intensifi them .
we must talk about this grow inconsist .
i would like more euro-enthusiasm over the budget .
( applaus ) mr barroso , i welcom your statement .
there ha obvious been some movement in this area .
what is happen there ?
the treati state that this debat must take place .
parliament doe not wish to go beyond it remit .
which point ha the council refus to discus ?
quit the contrari .
i believ that we have a duti to reach an agreement .
we have a respons to our citizen .
we must not allow confid to wane in europ 's institut .
but let me talk about the futur .
in for a penni , in for a pound .
ceterum censeo there is a need for the european union .
this is what i want to say , and keep up the good work .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
i am exclud that .
instead , we are call for complianc with the treati .
noth el , noth more and noth le .
therefor , we need to respond .
this wa clear proof of disciplin and rigour .
we will have to find common ground .
the credibl of the european union is at stake .
we need to see progress on the part of the council .
how could you explain this to u ?
is it possibl to move forward in our direct ?
we have certain expect .
it is veri import for u to have such an answer from you .
mr schulz , i did hear your question .
i believ no one ha been spare .

written statement ( rule 149 )
parliament 's grievanc are not ridicul .
we can not afford to give in to nation egoism .
present of the commiss work programm for 2011 ( debat )
the present mark a begin and an end .
in 2011 , the commiss will tabl the remain piec of regul .
when competitor are cheaper , we must be smarter .
a particular focus in 2011 will be on energi effici .
our compani should focus on busi , not bureaucraci .
this is a european union at the servic of the citizen .
now is the time to maintain momentum .
we need to find way to collect acceler our work .
europ 's citizen would expect this .
thank you for your attent .
europ 's economi must be found on work .
europ ha learnt much from the crisi .
unfortun , previous experi are not good .
i will come back to this point later on .
the first issu is growth polici .
we simpli do not have enough .
my second point concern the intern market .
you are right , mr barroso .
the concept of the intern market must be made public .
more need to happen in this area .
it purpos is to improv social welfar .
my third point relat to tax polici .
we believ that the propos made in this area are too weak .
i believ that we need to make progress in this area .
this is a veri import issu .
we must work togeth to explain what we do more effect .
the citizen ' initi will soon be start .
it oppon will exploit it and use it against europ .
whi am i say this ?
becaus want to be the best is not suffici to be the best .
but that is not enough .
you have the monetari report .
do we need more regul to tackl the financi crisi ?
yes , but onli if the aim is to foster europ 's competit .
now a word on the european semest .
otherwis , we will wit the rise of real anti-european .
i wish you good luck .
mr swoboda ha alreadi mention green issu .
radic chang would definit not benefit this area .
your choic are therefor ineffect .
in my opinion , the solut is not auster in wage or budget .
but i am afraid nobodi in the commiss is listen to me .
the same thing is happen in ireland .
whi not adopt a labour market with european ad valu ?
this is miss in the programm and i strong propos it .
the progress forc must stick togeth in this case .
it is also import that we convey this messag correct .
parliament and the commiss must look to the futur togeth .
despit that , i do have some comment to make .
such measur are counterproduct in a crisi .
howev , i think this belong to a longer discus .
i will dwell on a few specif topic .
unfortun , there is noth about this in the work programm .
what do we find now in this work programm ?
anoth studi ha been commiss .
we can not go on like this .
we were plea to welcom the packag on econom govern .
achiev this target is critic .
the project are on the tabl , or will be soon .
2011 will be a decis year .
we appreci commission barnier 's pro-act .
that is what we are expect from the commiss today .
i would like to remind him of that .
could i just make one final point ?
some problem : educ .
( hu ) mr presid , i will tri to be veri brief .
it would certain be worthwhil to make progress here .
that is true .
i believ the european commiss ha the power to chang thing .
we are not ask them not to reduc their contribut .
thank you veri much .
today , howev , life ha brought massiv chang .
howev , that realli is not enough .
our object for 2011 have , therefor , been establish .
the number of strategi which we have adopt is suffici .
( sk ) mr presid , the work programm submit is ambiti .
i place the emphasi on acceler adopt .
we all know what a lengthi busi european legisl is .
i agre with all of you who say that we need to do better .
you will also find this in our programm .
the debat is close .
the vote will take place dure the part-sess in decemb .
written statement ( rule 149 )
this show that financi specul is continu uncheck .
depend on ' .
may adopt ' .
in 2012 ' .
the excus chosen by the budget wrecker are rather feebl .
we must , on the contrari , increas flexibl in a crisi .
the commiss ha commit itself to these thing .
it is time they were done .
an agenda for new skill and job ( debat )
yes , the crisi ha wipe out million of job .
on the contrari , it is a call to act and shape our futur .
creat more and better job is in our hand .
we must enabl everyon who can work to actual do so .
new skill and job ' propos practic tool in this respect .
commission vassiliou will be abl to say more about this .
last , but certain not least , we need to creat more job .
the european union ha plenti of talent .
urgent action is therefor need , especi on the educ side .
we all agre on the diagnosi .
upgrad skill should not be a luxuri for the high qualifi .
it is a necess for all .
this will build on the popular europa cv .
in time of crisi , especi acut crisi , we need a vision .
these two statement give u a vision .
they are ambiti .
there are issu relat to entrepreneurship .
we must make it easier for busi to take on more peopl .
we are at your side ; we shall monitor and fight with you .
there is an absolut necess to lock the two togeth .
i do not know about you , commission , but that shook me .
what have you done instead ?
you have reviv the old subject of flexicur .
howev , poverti is not a good accompani to progress .
are we sure we know all the need of young peopl ?
will the result we achiev be posit ?
will they be encourag ?
whi is this ?
becaus it is all about the futur .
none at all .
i would like to thank you for your initi .
you refer to these a open-end contractu arrang .
in my view , this will not creat ani new job .
we must not allow this to happen in futur .
more than 20 % of them do not have a job .
i welcom the agenda present much more than the strategi .
the commission mention better educ and invest in peopl .
i fulli agre with her on this .
an eco-effici economi obvious requir new skill .
i wish to draw attent to the high school dropout rate .
educ guarante a futur for young peopl .

i veri much hope so .
i thank the commission for that respons .
what is the commission 's view on that ?

i can not go into the detail .
i also ask for your understand on this .
you have seen our state aid rule compet .
subject : creat a common european conscienc
in 2008 , the commiss establish the eu sport forum .
commission barnier is deal with this question .
of cours , i will follow veri close what he doe .

it is the member state which decid on this matter .

member state are also lose out on excis duti .
a he said , tobacco smuggl is a veri lucrat busi .
we realli need to tighten up our regul .
member of the commiss . - i will tri to be veri brief .
subject : common consolid corpor tax base
subject : ireland 's corpor tax rate
subject : common consolid corpor tax base ( ccctb )
the commiss ha no plan to make propos on corpor tax rate .
i would like to thank the commission for his repli .
i think that act a a disincent for foreign direct invest .
that conclud question time .
( the sit wa suspend at 20:35 and resum at 21:00 )
their situat is receiv our constant attent .
a countri can be admir for it econom achiev .
this is not serious .
in sum , this is a terror state .
it ha react excess harsh , both intern and extern .
i believ that this is regrett .
that is simpli unaccept .
i hope that in this hous we will be just that .
that , i believ , is fundament our main issu .
we know that there are doubl standard here in europ .
we must therefor start the houseclean here .
it is a piti there are so few of u here for such a debat .
we enjoy the support of democrat countri .
that nobel prize becam a catalyst of chang .
there are other case pend .
delay such reform ha a terribl human cost .
that wa the first thing i want to share with you today .
the debat is close .
cap simplif ( debat )
unfortun , i have to point out one fli in the ointment .
a larg proport of the respons lie with the member state .
you are not yet respons for this , mr cioloş .
that is someth that need to be address in the reform .
that may well lie behind the measur taken in scotland .
i apologis most profus for that .
i fear , howev , that what we are get is not that .
let the farmer produc the food .
can i comment on what mr lyon just said ?
whi are we have this ?
it is not the commiss that is ad administr task .
the commiss onli appli exist council regul .
there is still the need to simplifi at member state level .
to my mind , there are two aspect to this issu .
first , there is everyth to do with the request for aid .
i have in mind the exampl of crop rotat .
this repres a consider amount of work for the futur .
they go there with a critic eye to find what is not right .
their job is to produc food , not to write book .
i imagin this is the commiss 's favour approach .
we are continu inund with complaint .
how can this be remedi ?
simplif itself is not suffici .
what they need is a simpler and more respons cap .
it must be greener and contribut to climat chang mitig .
all of this , perhap , on a decreas budget .
i think you have plenti of ammunit .
that is far too mani .
it is time to act upon this report .
bureaucraci must not ruin u .
global food demand will continu to grow in futur .
i hope that this will not be the case here .
that is high commend .
there are a lot of thing that can be done .
this is simpli ridicul .
effort toward this are undoubt worthwhil , commission .
i want to repeat my comment of last thursday .
we are fool ourselv in this hous .
i describ it a green tape ' .
there is a climat of fear .
we have to break that climat of fear .
in mani case , the cap is help farmer to work .
the debat is close .
written statement ( rule 149 )
in write . - let me pose a simpl question .
whi is there a common agricultur polici at all ?
europ ha an abund of fertil agricultur land .
we still have farmer will and abl to produc food .
this , in itself , distort competit on the intern market .
it is not yet known how these payment will be made .
the situat in the beekeep sector ( debat )
the sector is certain face a number of challeng .
we make it clear where the problem lie .
that is our messag .
in ani event , we will make sure that this happen .
we owe this to the bee .
incident , i believ that the discus ...
( the presid cut off the speaker )
howev , that is not enough .
we must ensur that these programm are continu after 2013 .
they are absolut crucial to agricultur and food product .
inde , without them , there is no food product .
i think we have an opportun to do someth posit .
let u support the bee .
no chang there then .
in truth , these are all guess .
i am glad to see it and to be abl to take part in it .
without bee , mani crop would fail .
i think we can pay tribut to her this even .
in europ , mani beekeep have had to shut up shop .
madam presid , commission : thank you for your comment .
the commission state that she is satisfi .
we also need greater emphasi on organ and ecolog method .
i would just like to concentr on one issu .
the inform campaign is there .
it just need to be pick up on .
we need to find long-term effect solut to this press issu .
the role of bee in plant pollin is indispens .
we have to stop experi with what we grow and what we eat .
yes , europ can be use .
this exampl of bee is mayb repres of european integr .
we have a problem and we do not know the reason for it .
i support the call for research but with some caution .
beekeep also promot econom develop in rural area .
she buzz around parliament like a bee .
so you could say that she is the queen bee of parliament .
there are a number of issu which have been rais .
two point are particular import to me in this respect .
this is perhap someth that could be develop .
so i think we have got target ahead of u .
they will no doubt also be includ in the cap after 2013 .
the debat is close .
the vote will take place on thursday ( 25 novemb 2010 ) .

the european union regret this of cours .
i am look forward to hear your view .
the past few month have been a challeng .
our econom govern is be transform .
all this action is not take place in a vacuum .
the atmospher at the summit wa intim , friend , and focus .
we must therefor address our citizen ' valid concern .
peopl are scare .
and everi time the same few countri oppos it .
mr presid , i would like to add one last thing .
no , the realiti in europ is somewhat differ .
that is the realiti in europ .
everyon know that and it also need to be said open .
mr merkel and mr sarkozi then say good , let u do that ' .

i am almost finish .
we live in a democrat age and under a democrat system .
( applaus )
dear colleagu , we must go ahead .
i will take it into account .
i will ask you , colleagu , to apologis to the chamber .
the view express by herr schulz meet the case .
he is an undemocrat fascist .
colleagu , we expect someth quit differ .
we do not want our discus to be disturb in such a way .
it is imposs to hold our discus in such an atmospher .
i shall read articl 152 ( 3 ) in my mother tongu .
( applaus )
well , we saw what the outcom of that wa .
this must be taken serious .
in fact , what exact is the problem ?
we must go beyond the council 's decis .
we saw it in 2004 and 2005 with franc and germani .
no action wa taken against mr schulz .
what mr schulz is do now is exact the same ...
( the speaker continu but his microphon wa switch off )
i must bring this convers to an end .
i am will to talk with you .
we will talk about it togeth .
the complet absenc of this spirit is one of our problem .
econom govern is what need to take shape now .
we all know that .
it is one thing to talk now about tax dump in ireland .
someth need to chang here .
we know that the countdown ha begun for spain and portug .
this is someth that we need to weigh up togeth .
thank you for your attent .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
peopl know that auster packag are necessari .
they are told just how indebt their countri are everi day .
doe the ladi appreci or understand that ?
so i will defend the eu 's spend in my constitu everi day .
doe the economi dictat our polici ?
there is chao .
the money is run out .
i should thank mr van rompuy .
just look at these face .
look at the fear .
look at the anger .
poor old barroso here look like he ha seen a ghost .
it is pretti clear that none of you have learn anyth .
but is this not realli just the bunker mental ?
your fanatic is out in the open .
they should never have join the euro .
but look at your respons to them .
just who the hell do you peopl think you are ?
you are veri danger peopl inde .
well it will not work , becaus it is portug next .
after that , i suspect it will be spain .
there will not be ani more .
i call on these institut to be more respons toward taxpay .
i would just like to say one more thing regard cancún .
the eu want to speak with one voic .
i have two question , howev .
where doe that leav pandora , i ask myself .
thank you in advanc for your answer .
just look at the idea of a financi transact tax .
some thing are clear .
i think you prefer practic action : i understand that .
we are talk here about a debt crisi in our member state .
i would also like it to remain that way .
howev , we are join togeth in a share destini by the euro .
deauvill wa a mistak .
germani and franc have been blackmail by the unit kingdom .
the financ minist must take the decis again here .
what is econom govern ?
there is a big question mark here .
( de ) mr presid , of cours i am happi to answer that .
howev , the decis made in deauvill wa clear a mistak .
it doe not have to be like this , howev .
mr presid , this is a debat about econom govern .
i hope we have final drawn a line under those account .
it need to be put into practic .
where wa mr trichet ?
so it is time to say bye-by euro , bye-by euro .
mr schulz 's scold is therefor complet uncal for .
there ha been a lack of complianc here .
i just do not understand some of this complain .
we will have our say in the codecis procedur .
then we will negoti on this matter again with the council .
this is the realiti .
( pt ) mr presid , let u be frank .
when a process wa set up it wa done too late .
the commiss and the new presid must uphold this agenda .
this is what we need to show the european public .
( pl ) mr presid , the crisi in the euro area is a fact .
quit clear , the exact opposit ha happen .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
welcom , colleagu .
that is not our interpret of econom govern .
invest is also need .
it is obvious , therefor , that growth need to continu .
what is europ now ?
what will it be in the futur ?
trust is base on a reason balanc of incom and expenditur .
it will facilit the detect of emerg imbal and risk .
how long are they go to insist on go down this rout ?
there are mani peopl over there also in denial .
for good sake , wake up .
i believ this is the biggest crisi that we have had .
member state have been affect across the spectrum .
solv this issu is a matter of urgenc .
the hors ha alreadi bolt .
there is no go back , measur must be taken .
we need both communiti solidar and coordin action .
this is the behaviour of what are main socialist .
do you rememb ?
the answer to this is no ' .
is this solut under serious discus with these countri ?
there are a few lesson to be learn .
we have to learn lesson .
let me say the follow .
this is go to chang next januari .
so i want to underlin this point .
we are still live in veri difficult condit .
i think what we need now is action and not more comment .
we are deal with veri sensit global financi market .
we are for ambiti econom govern for europ .
but in the end , we have to be realist .
some of you said the problem are in the euro area .
i am sorri to say they are not onli in the euro area .
the euro ha not been the problem .
( applaus )
( applaus )
that is the respons method that we have to follow .
( applaus )
it is the veri first time in my career .
we alreadi know about that .
it is time to take action .
some of you have said that we should learn lesson .
there is a french proverb that say our act follow u ' .
we would have discov the properti bubbl .
so we are go to introduc it now .
that is the onli reason .
we had no crisi mechan befor .
have member state assum their respons ?
mani of them have .
we are assum our respons .
honour member , let u not alway target the wrong enemi .
let u not get our enemi wrong .
allow me to give you the figur .
it financi sector is not too high for the countri .
it bank are well capitalis .
let u not target the wrong enemi .
i insist on this point : let u not target the wrong enemi .
i am not make a critic .
they are right , but we must go through that stage first .
howev , we do need a posit polici for growth and employ .
it is also growth that is also fed by intern demand .
the debat is close .
written statement ( rule 149 )
and what is more , becaus they belong to the euro area .
it is beyond belief .
this is not govern ; it is totalitarian .
but now realiti ha hit .
there must be an end to the transfer union .
we can not keep patch up a sick monetari union .
instead we need a strong , core european monetari union .
i am sceptic about the anti-crisi mechan .
result of the g20 summit ( debat )

howev , there is no shortag of issu .
that is the first point .
in this respect , i shall offer you a suggest .
we must be a proactiv forc , we must be a decis forc .

a new energi strategi for europ 2011 - 2020 ( debat )
we can achiev this by undertak certain measur .
we talk about this in the report .
we need a european energi communiti .
we , a member of the european parliament , insist on this .
we have a singl market that is not yet complet .
second , we have a patent lack of infrastructur .
this ha to do with accept by the peopl and transpar .
anoth part of our strategi is the issu of afford energi .
research is anoth import aspect .
we do not want that to happen .
( applaus )
someth must be done to tackl energi poverti .
ten year ago , there wa noth .
today , china repres 50 % of global windmil product .
china is move and they move fast .
come on europ , come on commiss ; let 's walk the talk .
( applaus )
my first messag is , implement , implement , implement ' .
we do not need a new energi polici .
then we have to add target polici to that .
you mention energi effici .
the second concern the intern market .
jen rohd is right .
gas will be import , a will oil in the futur .
i have two concret question for you .
this is one of the biggest obstacl .
otherwis , our reaction will simpli be unbalanc .
i do not think we should act like this .
this is the first realist strategi we have seen .
we have two small pipelin : the itgi and the tap .
they are readi , they are up to speed .
you can move forward .
move forward , therefor , with the two small pipelin .
the reason is that there is a veri simpl exampl of this .
she also point to the respons of enterpris .
this bring u to the singl market .
we still lack 50 % of financ for the set-plan .
it undermin the whole strategi .
our decis in europ are crucial for our competit .
a penni save is a penni gain .
energi effici is also the cheapest way of reduc co2 emiss .
the energi sector is the drive forc behind econom growth .
we welcom the commiss 's strategi , therefor .
energi effici is top of this rank order .
this is crucial .
it take mani year to get energi facil up and run .
the servic life of such construct is sever decad .
the european parliament must be given codecis power .
whi is the drive forc of progress not effect ?
there is no need for new supplementari bind target .
there is still a gap between word and deed .
this is where the eurobond are necessari .
action : that is what is need .
for natur gas suppli this figur may reach 80 % .
unfortun , veri littl ha been said about this today .
nevertheless , we must take these extra step .
mr reul is right : we need mani energi sourc .
these are the engin of a future-ori european economi .
this is precis what is not need .
this report contain the solut .
infrastructur , infrastructur , infrastructur .
thank you .
second , it emphasis intellig infrastructur .
we have ambiti aim to reduc the climat chang process .
construct of the 522 turbin will be complet in 2011 .
the p8 pipelin is a good exampl of this .
will we get consensus in europ ?
if we do , what will the consensus be ?
that is the strategi for the new decad .
it is right that we need a long-term strategi .
not an easi undertak .
our estim would have been complet wrong .
what new polit interest the member state will have ?
it is quit simpli becaus that wa what wa decid .
if you want someth differ , let me know .
the subject of energi effici wa mention .
in our strategi we are onli creat the head for this .
there have been question about the intern market .
plea trust me and mr almunia .
it is current 500 billion cubic metr per year .
will it be le or will it be more ?
this will also be address in the road map 2050 .
mr rohd mention the exampl of china .
i do not agre with that .
thank you onc again .
i also need you when it come to the european budget .
i go along with that .
we have work out a certain consensus .
the debat is close .
written statement ( rule 149 )
this repres a failur in all aspect of the state object .
the new propos energi strategi aim to serv this need .
the potenti of this sector in europ is untap .
this matter is particular import for poland .
better late than never , howev .
we assum that it sincer regret it decis .
what , in fact , doe it mean ?
focus on an all or noth ' approach is no longer possibl .
what , then , are the main element of the eu 's posit ?
what are these condit ?
i am also look forward to work with you in cancún .
what is a substanti balanc packag ?
i can tell you honest today : we are almost there .
no chang there .
from that we can improv thing .
that is the way our prioriti will best be heard .
inde , whi should they ?
our industri is invest money and manpow in develop .
i am a farmer by profess .
let u concentr on prepar good ground .
the outcom wa not so good .
how are we go to do that ?
we will do it , a repres of europ , by take a lead role .
that is a simpl fact .
whi should we contribut toward it ?
i want to see our cap tighten .
i want u to move up from 20 % to 30 % .
i just do not feel that this is happen at the moment .
i know this commission 's enthusiasm for the subject .
i am not sure she ha the full back of the colleg .
but mayb we need a fallback posit ?
that legisl ha got to be ambiti .
we have got to save our resourc .
we have got to becom more competit .
today , if we make no chang , we shall reach 19 % .
we know 30 % is possibl .
obvious not .
everi studi show this to be so .
i should also like to cite some figur .
he lost the elect .
this goal is import .
there is a need for new long-term fund sourc a well .
a strong messag is need .
the report then launch into utopian request .
mr presid , choos sunni mexico for cop 16 wa a good move .
how can we do that ?
the peopl do not understand the problem .
whi is that ?
that is the problem .
my fellow member present the figur .
of cours , we also need to have honesti on the market .
you have our support , commission .
therefor , let u make this decis .
therefor , my appeal for greater communic is import .
here too , we are reli on everyon el .
i believ that our offer should be to establish kyoto ii .
we will have no problem do this ; we will achiev it .
we had one microphon for the eu .
that is the first point i should like to emphasis .
this show the import and the urgenc of what we must do .
the second point is that of credibl .
this is a great mistak .
this polici is go nowher .
addit fund must be provid for financ climat measur .
what we are experienc are normal temperatur fluctuat .
what wa the object of the climat chang confer , now ?
ah , yes , it wa the reduct of co2 emiss .
what wa the object of the climat chang confer , again ?
oh , yes , it wa the protect of forest .
mr presid , may i offer the eu some modest advic ?
mr hassi also spoke about lulucf .
she is absolut right .
let u be honest about this .
more ambit , more fund and better negoti are what is need .
now that is be realist .
cancún would be not near a bad , of cours .
it is much warmer .
but be warn : we , the peopl , are onto you .
( e ) mr presid , commission , i share this hous 's aspir .
the credibl of the ipcc ha been shot to piec .
copenhagen fail for the same reason that cancún will fail .
it is time to chang cours .
howev , i would like to comment on some of the amend tabl .
we must remain credibl .
this attitud must not win at cancún .
it is a veri difficult compromis for all countri .
among these are the unit state and china .
they should have access to money from the union .
anyth el would be counterproduct .
we have had enough of that .
greater author involv greater respons .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
we will find the solut by break with this system .
reach an agreement on cut carbon emiss is vital import .
we urgent need to make progress in combat climat chang .
so-cal carbon offset is no solut in this context .
i trust that these effort will be fruit .
realist , we should make substanti progress .
now my three comment .
i would argu probabl not .
it is not the pessimist who achiev big thing .
two year ago we were more or le alon in set target .
that wa someth we actual gain .
somebodi refer to the emerg economi .
we must tri to build on that in cancún , and we will .
there were some question on the cdm .
yes , it is a problem .
we all know that that is the reason whi .
the altern is veri bad ; it is veri grim .
it is not a matter of adjust our ambit .
the debat is close .
the vote will take place on thursday , 25 novemb 2010 .
written statement ( rule 149 )
in write . - ( hu ) toward a post-kyoto protocol ...
it is no longer possibl to deni global climat chang .
we must adopt a respons and long-term solut .
we have a respons for the futur of the whole world .
howev , we must stand togeth firm and in uniti .
the climat negoti in cancún start in onli a week .
the debat ha alreadi gone on long enough .
europ remain africa 's most import partner .
prepar for the summit is therefor proceed .
we hope that these discus will lead to concret result .
at the same time , our relat go far beyond that .
the cooper opportun of the two contin are enorm .
both mr chastel and mr piebalg have spoken about this .
a if it were written by somebodi wear rose-tint spectacl .
the realiti is , howev , far from rosi .
on the african side , disintegr still prevail .
in short , it is hard to talk about africa a one unit .
europ ha an overwhelm respons in these area .
we must find an answer to these question .
how is this possibl ?
hooray , a the council said .
it grew rich by creat wealth .
it also despair of see these agreement sign rapid .
howev , i believ that we can do more than this .
over 100 million peopl do not have access to safe water .
the die can not wait .
the union is the largest donor of develop aid .
over half of offici support come from u .
we should be proud of this .
( fr ) madam presid , that would certain be possibl .
but ultim onli african can solv africa 's problem .
we alreadi have this strategi .
we are thus face with sever challeng .
it is veri much reminisc of the behaviour of coloni state .
that will creat work that is sustain .
howev , we have been veri poor at implement such object .
second , what is the eu do to activ promot good govern ?
this is how we must see the forthcom eu-africa summit .
it is a problem that must be resolv .
of cours , the african contin ha a whole rang of problem .
howev , we know that there is still much to be done .
the econom crisi ha unsettl and is still unsettl europ .
africa ha more self-confid ; and good reason for it .
howev , it is veri clear that there is an african union .
that mean that this summit is a veri particular summit .
it is definit not a donor/recipi summit .
i believ that we need to address two critic issu .
that is whi we address the issu of energi .
the second issu is veri serious polit debat .
yes , good govern and human right are on the agenda .
it is a two-way street .
it is not that we wish to preach .
sustain is also to the fore in our polici .
we do not financ the serengeti project , for exampl .
we have a veri sustain approach to the project .
i believ that this is a veri particular summit .
that is rather fragil .
i should also like to repli to one question in particular .
the debat is close .
written statement ( rule 149 )
situat in western sahara ( debat )
statement by the council and the commiss .
we believ this is unaccept .
the third point is close link .
this incid ha claim new human casualti , which we regret .
we know who they are .
commission , thank you veri much for your clear word .
we are not talk about a conflict between equal .
it all veri well to want good trade relat with morocco .
let u make that possibl .
i went there a few hour beforehand .
when will we say that this cours is unaccept ?
this is a good idea . it should be done .
i want to ask for calm from the parti .
i therefor ask the european union for greater commit .
realpolitik must not be an excus for turn a blind eye .
yes , we had to condemn the violenc on both side .
for these peopl the power of the world do not come togeth .
it is but a short step from neglig to complic .
this is the most signific polit fact .
we must get back to what matter .
so there , in essenc , are the challeng we believ import .
there have been 35 year of illeg suffer and occup .
would the truth be so hard to face ?
meanwhil , more and more moroccan settl there .
in my opinion , these incid must be fulli investig .
i veri much hope that a diplomat solut can be found here .
if it ha noth to hide , the inquiri should be carri out .
so whi is it not be done ?
i hope they will come and engag in a discus with u .
i believ that it is a stage of this dialogu .
this will present anoth opportun to continu this dialogu .
i believ that it is veri balanc and veri correct .
i would just repeat the last sentenc .
that bring the debat to a close .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12:00 .
( the sit wa suspend at 20:00 and resum at 21:00 )

ukrain ( debat )
cathi ashton took part in the discus on intern issu .
ukrain is part of our neighbourhood .
let u get back to the summit .
this is obvious veri import .
this subject wa also rais in your resolut in februari .
these are fact .
it is good and import for u to make progress in this area .
i have to deplor a few mistak in the print of the text .
i hope this signifi progress in our relationship .
but let me be clear .
so far , so good - touch wood .
i veri much hope that that will continu to be the case .
that would not help the democrat develop of ukrain .
i think this ha been a veri good thing .
it is for ukrainian , and we are adopt it togeth .
that probabl also repres a defeat for the european union .
the eu is therefor clear lose it attract for ukrainian .
that wa evid at the summit .
the commission mention the law on public procur .
a major except to this ha just been adopt .
at least that wa how it wa express in the german translat .
( de ) mr presid , ladi and gentleman , let u be frank .
sad , the local elect have not live up to our expect .
mr harm is sit in the middl .
this is import on all side .
yes , those elect were not conduct in the way we want .
thing happen there which should not have happen .
we need to exercis moder , here .
i do , howev , find two issu miss from the report .
one of them is a mention of minor in the ukrain .
this is extrem import .
emot have subsid .
what is this resolut about ?
they are respons , becaus it is they who hold power .
there are two klitschko .
sad , the huge potenti of that chang ha been wast .
we must also agre on the free trade agreement soon .
we are frighten by corrupt and it entangl with polit .
here we must creat real cooper .
while there , we saw protest and numer disturb .
howev , we also saw some posit sign .
at the same time , i would like to say someth el .
( lv ) mr presid , i have a question for all member .
whi did we need this resolut on ukrain at this time ?
thank you .
ukrain remain a key partner for the eu .
when the law wa pas we welcom it .
howev , subsequ amend alter the qualiti of the law .
the debat is close .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12:00 .
written statement ( rule 149 )
the elect were not free , fair or democrat .
furthermor , the european commiss negoti these agreement .
we can not explain this to our public .
it is therefor essenti to reconcil these differ issu .
i hope this will be reflect in the vote tomorrow .
we also tri to put an end to black or white debat .
the same is true for product process and method .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
you have a speak time of four minut .
i draw a rough line for everi member of this hous .
it certain is my job to interrupt .
i am oblig to interrupt member if they speak too quick .
you are veri welcom to have a look at it .
it is label slow down ' .
i have alreadi experienc this in the committe .
it is precis the same thing .
but allow me to make a few general consider .
the three report have mani point in common .
so there will alway be choic to be made .
on the other hand , it take two to tango .
this also appli to our bilater deal .
they must be implement ' .
i would like to remind you about this onc again .
we are sorri . '
i would like to focus primarili on one point .
the eu ha trade relat with pakistan , for exampl .
they will enabl it to network success with other economi .
what ha this got to do with the european union ?
mr presid , the document show a lack of econom understand .
end of quot .
what econom genius thought that up ?
it will be the citizen and busi .
this fill me , person , with veri great optim .
real north-south solidar is requir .
therefor , the barrier to green trade must be remov .
or may they compli on a voluntari basi ?
european citizen are becom more awar .
competit is necessarili distort .
the report refer to it appar negat impact on climat chang .
this would be a disast .
this must appli both to acp countri and to china .
we want to see legisl when this is necessari .
mr presid , competit is the life of trade .
that certain must be address .
we need more of that .
unfortun i can not be exhaust .
howev , our posit will be that we are in favour of this .
in short , congratul for the three report .
we will therefor continu the discus , a you said .
this is therefor , in a sen , an opportun .
mr presid , a you can see , i had two minut left .
all of this is absolut critic .
thank you veri much , mr désir .
the debat is close .
anti-dump case - state of play and prospect ( debat )
i would like to look at one point in particular .
what is the current state of affair ?
are there case of this kind ?
that is all well and good .
last , there is the question of dialogu with societi .
mr presid , we can now see the consequ here .
in concret term , this is about sell product below cost .
one reason for this is the lack of a function appeal bodi .
it wa a chine compani and a belgian electron compani .
i will give you anoth exampl .
whi is this happen ?
we must open up our market .
i look forward to hear your answer .
i strong condemn such action .
we are current examin the implic of the withdraw .
that is precis what ha happen in this case .
there , i would like to be veri clear .
we are not , becaus i truli believ it is not necessari .
i would consid do so onli onc the doha round is over .
there wa also a specif question by the green member .
they are taken on the basi of a complaint by a compani .
it need clear and enforc rule within the new comitolog .
anti-dump is a good servant but a bad master .
plea bear this in mind .
smes can particip in the proceed .
we have an sme helplin to make cooper easier .

the visa procedur should weigh heavili on our conscienc .
madam commission , you are from sweden .

becaus travel to sweden wa visa-fre .
so our initi outlook is clear posit .
visa facilit normal goe togeth with readmiss agreement .

that in itself is a polit decis .
these criterion are open .
they are transpar .

this , i believ , rais the issu of equal treatment .
so where are we today ?
basic , the great difficulti here is what to do .

we are not , i think , at all equal to the challeng .
i believ that the issu call for a more subtl approach .

the answer is no ' .
it would be extrem danger to make distinct .
that is a good thing .
it guarante differ right for differ group .
onli then will effici control be possibl .
that is guarante .
how can you suggest that it is not guarante ?
mr presid , that is simpli not true !
these exclus will not improv the situat .
instead , they will make it wors .
this will lead to social disast .
that is how it should be seen .
i welcom it and therefor endors it .
my predecessor propos this mani year ago .
it wa imposs .
it still is , so we therefor have this sector approach .
i do not like it , but it is the onli way to move forward .
we need to protect them .
it doe not creat discrimin .
nobodi want social dump .
we want to protect these peopl .
i share your view that we need to protect them .
we keep repeat this to the council .

we do not feel that is appropri for the current situat .
on his behalf , i present this to you .
do they realli need eu subsidi ?
in other word , it is cohes for competit .
to this i would like to add the region level .
we have clear fail to achiev territori cohes .
cohes polici can make a signific contribut to this .
if countri want to leav , they have the right to do so .

question hour with the presid of the commiss
we are readi to begin take question .
i would like to ask you the follow question :
presid of the commiss . - eurobond are an interest idea .
these instrument are far from exhaust .
i think the answer today is obvious .
will you support him in this ?
i have a specif question on the 2009 discharg .
it wa flat reject by the member state .
it will onli divid the euro area and the european union .
but the commiss ha alreadi made propos .
they were on the tabl and were reject .
that is the realiti .
we do not have a better altern to efsa .
howev , this is the system that i am oblig to adher to .
thank you for your answer .
that is a much a i can tell you at this stage .
we have seen some interest eurobond propos .
i feel rather poor inform in this regard .
mr barroso , rememb : we have discus this befor here .
( applaus )
we do not have one ; we have a presid of the commiss .
( interject from the floor from various member )
we would like to go ahead with the proceed .
that is my first point .
what we have is bias trade in favour of china .
we believ it is in our interest .
the topic is wikileak and cyber secur .
i would like to ask the same question .
you alreadi know my posit on this issu .
in june , we will make some concret propos on this issu .
( e ) mr barroso , what i am concern about is the content .
with regard to julian assang , i have no comment to make .
mr berlusconi is describ a mr putin 's spokesman in europ .
both sweden and the unit kingdom respect the rule of law .
we have to let the normal process of law go on .
i can not , therefor , comment on that .
i can not comment on them .
they have disappear .
what can and should the commiss do ?
it is not negoti .
data protect is also anchor in fundament right .
regard accus against a specif person , i am not a tribun .
she is develop this kind of action with our main partner .
we are work on that .
we believ there are serious cyber-secur threat .
we believ this is an import concern .
i fulli support those effort .
this is exact the line we are develop .
i would like u to consid three point :
are we look at a virtual guantánamo here ?
that is the danger , and we need answer on this matter .
frank , there ha been no result .
this leav the eu open to the charg of hypocrisi .
that is not true .
the commiss can not replac the member state .
in the meantim , a proper cyber war is rage .
we have put propos on the tabl to enhanc cyber secur .
but this is basic not a commiss issu .
this is my first question .
that conclud question hour .
i am plea about this .
this process ha by no mean finish .
it is a sore subject .
we must return to this debat , a it is by no mean over .
we are mere demand observ of the treati .
this ha not been a walk in the park .
this is realli veri import .
that is right .
this wa the lisbon treati test in practic .
this is a sign of our optim .
it is also import that we achiev some measur of progress .
the compromis that we want with the council were reject .
in this respect , parliament ha achiev a major success .
the matter ha been defer .
we have negoti hard and in a high controversi manner .
we want to discus our own resourc .
the commiss ha taken it posit .
on this issu , it ha side with parliament .
thus , the communiti institut are in agreement .
i believ that , in the end , this went in a posit direct .
i would like to compliment you great on your work .
the ald group would like a solut to be found to this .
everyon wa in agreement .
one month later , where are we on this ?
we have gone back to squar one .
the 2011 budget is about to be adopt .
it ignor flexibl and iter .
my group propos to adopt the budget a agre by the council .
it offer a small increas and that is a reason compromis .
unfortun , the debat on the budget had a fals start .
we have alway oppos that .
lisbon is clear on it .
the parliament lost this battl , a we predict .
the hothead here must cool down , particular the green .
is that the imag you want to offer the financi market ?
they would not be at all happi .
first , a few word on the budget itself .
howev , the final commit is a weak one .
moreov , these same govern also want to reduc flexibl .
other instead will complain that this is not enough .
european tax : a reason for a celebratori cocktail !
fortun , though , there is a caus for celebr .
long live member state , long live citizen !
should we draw conclus from this ?
i think we should .
should we cut back on agricultur aid ?
should we rein in the structur fund ?
some peopl want this , but the major say no ' .
for u social democrat , there are two issu here .
that is unaccept .
we must understand that .
look at greec , portug and ireland .
you have damag your caus immeasur .
i have two question about that .
i veri much doubt this .
my second question concern the european tax .
my question about this is : is an eu tax part of that ?
budget increas are alway difficult .
howev , the basic problem remain intact .
europ is financ it ambit by indulg in word .
there is no reason for u to have a provision budget .
negoti have obvious been difficult .
we are current in the posit of agre on figur .
a a result , there is a lack of fund for iter .
that work need to be recognis , a doe that of the council .
from my perspect , this new procedur need fine-tun .
we could and should do our work better .
we have made some gain in agricultur .
they are veri small , but my concern are for the futur .
i hope that that will not actual come to pas .
for this reason , i would like to thank all our negoti .
this issu of own resourc will resurfac in the come month .
is it ani wonder that eurosceptic is grow ?
this is ridicul !
doe the council have everyth that it want ?
doe parliament have everyth that it want ?
of cours not .
are we move forward ?
this codecis procedur ha function ; it ha work .
everyon ha made some compromis .
everyon ha made some concess .
is there still much to be done ?
of cours .
i believ that you realli must seiz this opportun .
i think that we realli must promot this logic .
mr lamassour , you spoke of budgetari solidar .
there is a lack of discus and a lack of understand .
we must hold joint debat on this increas dramat diverg .
i am plea to hear that .
in that case , he will probabl understand this now .
this need to be debat .
rather , the goal is to find an intellig financ system .
the council and parliament should be prepar to do that .
the debat is close .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12:30 .
written statement ( rule 149 )
agricultur is heavili depend on eu subsidi .
credit rate agenc ( debat )
mr presid , good afternoon to you all .

i would like to make one more comment on this .
i am alreadi look forward to your propos .
we owe this to our citizen .
initi , the commiss 's draft propos creat secur websit .
i wa never convinc .
there is therefor an urgent need for action .
that is an import and posit step in the right direct .
i would like to mention this onc again .
this , too , ha come to noth .
the second issu is the methodolog of rate .
the report is more than worthi of support .
esma will be brought into be .
the same is true here .

outcom of the climat chang confer in cancún ( debat )
the climat summit in cancún ha ultim been a success .
perhap i could briefli highlight a number of thing ?
first and foremost , adapt .
we have adopt a framework and establish a committe .
second , technolog .
support will be provid for both mitig and adapt .
third , the fight against deforest .
these are the specif achiev of cancún .
a you all now know , that is what we got .
this mean that the multilater process is aliv .
we want to save the process .
we work veri hard , togeth with the mexican presid .
a year ago , we took the first step in copenhagen .
that is realli good .
but in cancún , we also took new step .
on all three point , we made progress .
what doe that mean ?
this wa actual a veri import and signific step forward .
we have a long and challeng journey to make .
we saw in cancún how slow the process is .
the year ahead of u is a veri challeng one .
all must now take action , a we are do in europ .
that strategi will also includ a 2030 object .
we were discus earlier in this forum how import that is .
thank you veri much for that .
( applaus )
the detail have alreadi been mention .
we have a respons with regard to technolog transfer .
that should plea all of u .
i would just like to mention three point .
second , we have the green climat fund .
third , we must do our homework .
my final point is this : this climat confer is done .
now let u look to the next one .
the work must now be step up .
where is the ambit to cut co2 emiss by 50 % by 2050 ?
where are the post-kyoto commit ?
fudg and dodg and kick into the long grass .
how do we secur the fund ?
but mayb we have an answer to that .
in my group , the ecr , we believ in light-touch govern .
the govern must build on that achiev now .
the gap must be fill .
that scam ha alreadi caus student riot .
mr presid , i hope everyon enjoy cancún .
do these peopl think we were born yesterday ?
we are talk about scientist here .
the climat process is aliv and well .
we in the eu must show that leadership .
we have now promis a reduct of 20 % by 2020 .
we have a crucial year in front of u ahead of durban .
let u be clear .
that is what we need in durban .
so i have a veri simpl question for the commission .
i congratul everyon who contribut to this achiev .
it is clear that negoti is a huge and complex task .
it is a real challeng when there are so mani differ posit .
realli , societi is not be won over .
sever have ask about the 30 % .
i think all of you here know what the process is now .
it will have to be on the agenda .
we will continu that work .
in the last hour there , i sat with a check list .
a final word .
i therefor thank you veri warm for that .
the debat is close .
written statement ( rule 149 )
no decis ha been reach about such an agreement in cancún .
howev , it is better than noth .
it resembl noth so much a the danc process of echternach .
meanwhil , the global warm clock quiet tick on .
what wa europ 's role in this stori ?
europ is a role model when it come to climat .
the decis adopt repres real progress in negoti .
mexico organis a particip and transpar confer .
the eu play a lead role .
in particular , i welcom the creation of a climat fund .
it wa agre that there would be an agreement .
question time ( commiss )
the next item is question time ( b7-0655/2010 ) .
the follow question are address to the commiss .
subject : protect woman 's health
woman are at risk of lose their job faster than men .
we are not start from scratch here .
( lt ) i would also like to check someth .
we are also take action vis-à-vi the elder .
it doe not extend to inform about content .
it doe not suit you !
subject : young peopl and the labour market
is the greek govern to blame ?
briefli , this is a veri import , if sad , topic .
we have to be attent to specif case .
the first question is to mr rede .
i person will be here till midnight .
subject : gender equal in decis make
that is whi we need to speak with those who have respons .
i knew that this wa one of your favourit subject .
in addit , there is also this 17 % gender pay gap .
who is go to care for the elder , too ?
i complet agre with the figur which have been quot .
will the commiss say :
onli then do we submit legisl propos .
it is just ask for someth veri basic .
is that a reason for not act ?
on the contrari .
it is not a question of asylum alon .
you are involv in a traffic accid .
you have injur someon .
they will receiv an answer in write .
we now move to question to mr füle .
subject : enlarg of the eu to includ turkey
this will affect the overal progress of the negoti .
( de ) mr presid , i would like to apologis .
we had a group meet .
question time with mr rede began at 20:00 .
i thought that it would last half an hour , a schedul .
i therefor just miss my question .
i gave each commission 20 minut each .
mr posselt , i am veri sorri .
there are a number of reason for this .
subject : cooper between vojvodina and eastern croatia
in view of the abov , will the commiss say :
is it awar of the specif event outlin abov ?
is it concern about the rise in fanat nation ?
the result have so far been veri posit .
a for the second question , if i may continu .
albania and greec are close link by histori .
( de ) mr presid , thank you veri much for your generos .
i will be veri brief , commission .
that realli would be extrem import for the whole region .
we trust that these problem will be address .
yes , i have a question on belarus .
thank you for your present on the eve of christma .
commission , that is three question .
you have a maximum of three minut plea .
i will also includ my prepar speech .
their question have not been reach .
they will get a repli in write .
mr madlen , there realli is no time .
is this standard practic ?
that conclud question time .
( the sit wa suspend at 20:40 and resum at 21:00 )
energi effici action plan ( debat )
that is not good enough .
we are trail behind .
in china , the state subsidis these industri .
there is too littl focus on innov and on achiev result .
this will result in transpar for citizen .
the build polici is also import .
target will be set in relat to the 2050 road map .
build are absolut crucial in energi and climat polici .
forti percent of energi consumpt come from our build .
if we do not take action , we will not meet the target .
the level of consumpt refer to there is well-known .
in my countri - germani - probabl not .
twenti percent - of how much , we do not know .
that is sure not possibl .
we want to produc these by februari or march .
then we need to ask : where do we start ?
first of all , in the area of build stock .
we have to link these two togeth .
then come the subject of transport .
i doubt it .
stage 1 would be voluntari .
thank you veri much for today .
i am the rapporteur .
the environ committe ha adopt a comprehens opinion .
not everyth it contain is of equal import , either .
howev , i would like to emphasis two point onc again .
it is also a key element of our energi strategi .
for this to happen , sever problem need to be resolv .
in term of the futur , we are not clairvoy .
this technolog will allow u to achiev our goal .
it is also import to take region differ into account .
the question is : how do we achiev this goal ?
have we realli achiev more and had more of an effect ?
whi and in which area have we been use energi more effici ?
what is it in fact ?
how differ is it implement in the member state ?
( de ) mr presid , i have just one question for mr reul .
i will take today a my start point .
it sadden me that we have not achiev more .
perhap we need to choos a differ approach for that reason .
there have also been area of disagr , howev .
at the same time , we have seen that bind target do work .
the consequ of energi poverti are disastr .
energi save tick an aw lot of box .
first of all , climat chang .
second , energi secur .
i am a littl surpris at the debat that we are have here .
we are told that we do not need a bind object .
we are thus make one on renew .
final , citizen are today face the cold .
they are pay veri high price for their energi .
in my speech , i would like to focus on one issu .
first , it is import for u to set bind target .
we have to depend , unfortun in this case , on polit will .
in my opinion , that is the way to boost energi effici .
who know how much oil and gas we import in europ ?
who know how much oil and gas we extract in europ ?
what doe it mean for our popul ?
by import oil and gas , we are actual export money .
what do we know about the futur ?
by conserv energi .
thank you for your attent .
the conclus is veri clear in the report .
commission oetting mention the issu of languag .
we must , of cours , be a smart a possibl .
that is the right approach to take .
you mention this issu , commission .
let u put a stop to that wast !
howev , let u put everyth into perspect .
that is an incred challeng .
where can we make the biggest save ?
they have to be adapt to make them more energi effici .
they will not have to spend so much on energi .
now , that is an argument that you hard ever hear .
that is what this should be about !
it can do this on it own and produc a high social return .
we need to invest in this .
it is import that we chart the path forward .
we therefor also have to be activ at that level .
energi effici mean do more with fewer resourc .
it will be kind on both the environ and the wallet .
my second point is about region polici .
mr swoboda ha also spoken about this .
a great deal more could be done with those fund .
i believ that we have to spend in order to save .
negoti on climat chang are progress .
accord , the call for energi effici is also welcom .
howev , two quick point .
mr swoboda mention the import of local author .
i also want to ask a question to the commiss .
will we be abl to achiev this , commission ?
that is true , but not immedi .
you do not save the money in the first year .
in essenc , this repres an intergener contract in revers .
can we do this ?
are we readi to do so ?
i am count on you .
i have a second issu to rais a well .
i have to disagre , howev : it is not clear .
itali 's energi consumpt for 2007 wa 173 million tonn .
that then leav itali rough where it wa befor .
the project goe up and the 20 % is subtract .
or let u take portug a an exampl .
we urgent need to discus the project .
mani of you have risen to advoc bind target .
i am an optimist and a realist .
whether bind or voluntari , nation action plan are requir .
we would send back ani such plan on a polici basi .
thank you all veri much for today .
the report is an excel first step toward this .
it is someth that we need to do someth about .
we have enact legisl on a great mani thing .
whi is it so import now ?
could this money not be put to better use in europ ?
i would like to thank the commiss and the relev servic .
the debat is close .
written statement ( rule 149 )
we have a target of cut energi consumpt by 20 % .
innov is one of the key to success in this respect .
howev , financ still remain the most import issu .
in this , we need the assist of the commiss .
we must do everyth in order to minimis our disadvantag .
repeal of direct regard metrolog ( debat )
yet the council ha been block this packag for some time .
in the end , we agre on a le strict word in this regard .
in futur , member state may wish to enact nation rule .
we will continu to work toward that , at all event .
the commiss 's approach is reason .
we are no longer prepar to give way .
we should not push for harmonis in all area at ani price .
sometim , work is done swift in parliament .
everyon had their own particular issu .
onc again , i will be listen close to busi .
we therefor need to look veri close into this .
we , a parliament , are readi to play a part .
the debat is close .
safeti of toy ( debat )
that is whi i help initi this debat .
commission , i realli hope that this will actual happen .
this is not the onli problem , howev .
that is not alway the case , which is high regrett .
it is not , howev , a the commiss itself say .
market surveil measur have been reinforc .
now that is how we ensur safeti .
it is not go to be about mark .
the method of test , too , are not reliabl enough .
we need to give this some thought .
what doe that mean for u ?
i call on the commiss to take action in this area , too .
i hope that we will have these valu soon .
we will work close togeth on this .
a further meet is plan in april 2011 to conclud the work .
a further meet is schedul for januari 2011 .
i would like to ask two more specif question .
plea repli on the ce mark , which is the safeti guarante .
so what ha to be done ?
what is the most import is complianc with legisl .
therefor , we need to take action .
i believ i have answer most of the question put to me .
the debat is close .
written statement ( rule 149 )
therefor , this is a time issu .
the commiss must address this without delay .
agenda of the next sit : see minut
closur of the sit
open of the sit
implement measur ( rule 88 ) : see minut
the next item is the joint debat on :
howev , we realli need a perman mechan in the medium term .
what are they expect ?
how can we best reassur them ?
for me the answer is clear .
we face two particular issu with greec and ireland .
in both case we took the decis need .
we are move fast in this direct .
at the same time , public financ must be consolid .
this offer a real growth prospect for europ .
let u build on that by acceler growth-enhanc reform .
that is the object of the european stabil mechan .
the purpos of the treati chang is veri specif .
it need no more than a simpl chang to implement it .
there is massiv polit will behind the euro .
we are talk about someth which is veri import .
these are , of cours , close link .
when will we learn ?
i think we can talk direct to our friend .
this is what our citizen are ask u .
that take courag .
do not miss this opportun .
we have to show them the way .
( applaus )
help u ! ' .
this must not happen .
we are current prepar for a meet of the european council .
what about the differ voic there ?
one is in favour of eurobond and anoth is oppos .
that is simpli not enough .
it will heighten the crisi of confid .
we need a polici which stabilis the market and the euro .
today the euro is trade at 1.34 against the u dollar .
the euro is a stabl currenc .
such a thing exist nowher on earth .
and what are we be told here today ?
we need to wait for what ?
the one ha noth to do with the other .
there is no contradict between the two .
both are necessari , a is the case throughout the world .
propos it !
mr chastel , you spoke of the next summit .
it is no use just say that we took the right decis .
we are take one step forward and two step backward .
i am not say that it is your fault .
there is no stabil without solidar .
is he go to play the lotteri or what ?
that is it .
the onli solut in today 's debat .

i do not want histori to punish europ .
face up to your respons .
( applaus )

the failur of the euro is noth to do with specul .

and polit , of cours , you have to chang the treati .
what a farc this is .
you have not had a govern in your own countri sinc june .
here we have a non-nat tri to abolish our nation .
belgium is a microcosm of the entir european union .
belgium is about to fall to bit and the rest will follow .
happi christma , everybodi .
parliament wa not consult , despit my earlier question .
parliament need to know that it will be adequ .
third , what are the technic option and condit ?
this seem especi relev for those build debt in euro .
this issu is inextric link to the econom govern packag .
we have this crisi becaus both were undermin in the past .
fund will of cours be a key issu .
ani support from the esm will be base on strict condit .
let me also comment on the discus on the eurobond .
this wa reject by the ecofin council on 9 and 10 may .
it is all quit simpl .
specul can not be the caus of the problem .
the euro is a stabl currenc .
there is new turmoil in everi ecofin meet .
we are now say that the commiss did not act .
all of these thing are now on the tabl .
that includ portug , spain , the uk , hungari and latvia .
this is the result .
( de ) mr langen , you can sit down again now .
you have spoken veri eloqu and you have said your piec .
i have one question for you .
it is in northern europ .
ireland ha huge debt .
can you explain to u where the irish debt come from ?
( de ) mr presid , i am happi to answer that question .
we know that .
mr schulz , you know that a well a i do .
plea do not attempt to distract our attent .
( ro ) mr presid , to err is human .
to persever is diabol .
it wa definit not mr papandreou .
it wa karaman .
( uproar ) .
that is a fact and it ha noth to do with nation .
spain did not have to financ a reunif process .
howev , the zapatero govern in spain ha other problem .
second , we must rebal the propos legisl on econom govern .
final , we need new public financ sourc .
the crisi ha wipe out year of budgetari effort .
these are the reform we need urgent .
well , a it happen , there 's parliament .
under the treati of lisbon , we are colegisl .
we are go to do exact the opposit .
you can watch the train go by or you can work .
this parliament is go to tri to work .
so we will do our work .
( applaus )
this is an oversimplif that must be avoid .
we are do good busi on the back of this .
mr langen , you talk about reunif and you are right .
it wa the right thing to do .
( applaus )
countri are not liabl for each other 's debt .
this is also contain in articl 125 of the treati .
it is simpli not right .
peopl congreg in moscow : more social .
the end result will be exact the same .
this will not work .
healthi societi are built from the bottom upward .
that is just the way it goe .
a common econom polici for europ will not work .
i would just like to say a few word about eurobond .
this will not work .
it is an omin remind of the late 1920s .
now we must look to the futur .
we are caught in a trap .
we can expect the same thing to happen in my home countri .
in addit , we have a huge problem in the unit kingdom .
ladi and gentleman , you must wake up to what is happen .
the euro is therefor well worth strong defend .
presid trichet said 'a fiscal union ' .
i have my doubt about that .
i do not understand whi we are not take the follow rout .
eurobond are a sensibl solut .
whi do we not proceed a follow ?
we are say that these problem can be solv .
what do we need to enabl europ to act ?
how can we put money into the coffer ?
whi is it not possibl ?
whi doe the commiss not make a propos of this kind ?
i am wait for the commiss to make this propos .
you must stop tri to talk your way out of it .
i do not agre with mr bullman .
solidar had becom a one-way street .
the eu is in the process of do just the same thing .
it is undermin the competit abil of the various countri .
this will simpli make the gap wider .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
howev , this is not the case .
( de ) madam presid , mr schulz is right .
in fact , the situat is not under control .
the member state are react rather than actual take action .
the eu ha reach a critic turn point .
instead we will take a step backward .
what we need are further move toward integr .
we need more europ .
then we will have laid the foundat for them .
we must final tell the citizen the truth .
madam presid , let u start with the good news .
first , what should be the natur of privat sector involv ?
second what treati chang are you talk about ?
this issu need to be clarifi .
that is fine , but it is not enough .
the ten year of the lisbon strategi were a lost decad .
how could we have got into such a situat ?
today the council is propos an intergovernment mechan .
( applaus )
let u stop play with europ .
this realli is all about europ .
i endors everyth that mr klinz ha said .
it doe not repres a solut .
do not tri to make it more import than it realli is .
put an end to the discord .
then we have seen what ha happen .
we can have eurobond for other reason . mayb .
that is a way of take respons for deliber polici .
now we see the bitter result .
mr schulz , can you deni that ?
the countri is itali and it prime minist is mr berlusconi .
that is the messag to mr schulz and other .
we will then finalis that part of the speak time .
doe he rememb this ?
now you can see the bitter result .
i want to underlin that .
that is worth rememb .
i think it should be put on the record .
mr lambert also draw attent to these problem .
let him cast the first stone ...
this will be achiev a a result of collect wisdom .
this follow 14 % pay cut in the public and privat sector .
the under econom trend in ireland are quit good .
whi do they do that ?
becaus of the tax situat in delawar .
now is the time to start the singl digit market .
their goal is to ensur macro-financi stabil .
they should not be use to solv other current problem .
i would say that mr barroso 's propos were veri interest .
we would like to see them act upon .
it is imper that we do not mask realiti .
there is public spend , which we must cover or reduc .
there are public and privat debt , which we must repay .
there are numer expert who have idea on everyth .
but in a difficult situat , let u use common sen .
madam presid , first a complaint .
you said this is an import debat , and it is .
they are all to be welcom .
that should not be done .
debat such a this lead nowher .
can you clarifi that matter for this hous ?
( the presid cut off the speaker )
this just lead to more question :
( the presid cut off the speaker )
madam presid , most ordinari peopl see crise a tragedi .
for conserv , promis are tactic , not oblig .
( pl ) madam presid , the end of the year is approach .
whi did we not adher to it provis ?
these came from all side .
i would like to talk about anoth matter .
howev , it is relat ineffect .
the exist system includ sanction option .
first , the euro area is not enough in itself .
the second issu relat to parliamentari polit control .
this is not an emerg mechan , it is a perman one .
we need measur to halt specul on sovereign debt .
what should be done ?
in the commiss 's view we have five avenu of action .
everi member state should stick to it fiscal target .
( applaus )
mr swoboda , i fulli support what you have said .
it is veri rude and lack in respect .
mr de rossa , a point of order ?
- that onli touch on a point of order .

therefor , i have oppos the budget for 2011 .
in write . - ( de ) i have vote in favour of the report .
this compromis seem to be workabl .
howev , there are part of this budget i can not agre with .
it is for this reason i chose to abstain on budget 2011 .
i also agre that :
i believ that eu regul in this field should be univers .
poland is not among them .
the czech republ is repres in the european parliament .
in write . - divorc is a serious matter .
quit often it involv broken dish and divid properti .
the idea is good , but it need to be polish .
90 % of divorc are tragedi and scandal .
we need a law , not rule .
for this reason , i have abstain from vote .

nor doe their arbitrari natur .
the public author have given up .
it is shame .
i vote in favour .
i have taken this into account when vote .
i vote in favour of parliament 's resolut a i agre that :
for this reason , i have vote in favour of the report .
metrolog is the scienc of measur .
direct 2004/22 wa an import step in this movement .
this could onli be achiev by amend them .
member state will verifi the statement of support .
such a two-way flow is mutual benefici .
therefor , i have vote in favour of the report .
this justif will be made public .
that is whi we abstain .
i remain a support of repres democraci .
i vote for this text .
after all , this is what true democraci mean .
some of our critic are a follow :
busi are not exclud from the initi .
third-parti nation who live in the eu can not take part .
i wish to emphasis a few point which must not be overlook :
that mean 20-30 million euro to introduc a new law .
who will financ this action ?
is this not then a fake ?
a point to rememb : mep also repres these peopl .
it should be open and transpar .
today we vote in plenari on the european citizen ' initi .
that will scare peopl off .
some will fear ident fraud .
this will creat an inequ in the law within the eu .
this is not a new concept .
the european citizen ' initi can chang this .
we also like to talk about european integr .
these concern issu relat to human right .
the issu to be tackl includ : 1 .
for all these reason , we are compel to vote against .
the plan for the eu 's trade polici are of great import .

these are just some exampl .
this resolut is therefor about neo-coloni .
this is no longer a relationship between donor and recipi .
i vote in favour .
anoth problem which need to be resolv is corrupt .
we must appli the principl of help peopl to help themselv .

in this respect , the role of advertis is ambival .
the commiss must address these attack on consum privaci .

that is whi i vote a i did .
it is a channel of communic .
last , onlin advertis is often aggress and intrus .
it need to be look into in greater depth .
in write . - i vote in favour for a number of reason :
1. it is time to recognis all mass medium in the internet ;
3. in order to restrict access to vulner group like child ;
5. in order to induc veri strict rule regard announc ;
let u work and get it done .
howev , the use of unfair busi practic must be prevent .
howev , it carri mani danger .
howev , abov all it is an import econom sector .
i should like to congratul mr juvin on his excel work .
advertis can effect challeng and confront stereotyp .
that is whi i support the report .
mani peopl even feel that they are be watch .

these two dimens must be reconcil with one anoth .
the energi question ha now taken on a differ aspect .
energi effici mean do more ' with fewer ' resourc .

otherwis , what do we see ?
that is good .
this ha been debat in parliament .
and what are the major lesson ?
europ need both .
we are not , a some say , in a post-crisi ' scenario .
at most we might be in a post-recess ' scenario .
it is not , therefor , just a question of auster .
auster could caus the economi to contract .
doe a true impact ass exist ?
ani other reform will be insuffici .
one of those wa the social claus , articl 9 .
whi ha this happen ?
can i ask you to confirm or deni this situat ?
madam presid , i will be brief .
there is noth bind about ani of that .
we constant hear about macroeconom monitor .
so where is articl 9 ?
it is oblig to do so under the treati of lisbon .
when are we go to see it ?
when are we go to have an opportun to discus it here ?
i repeat , the minimum wage .
these are question which the commiss must respond to .
we do not want ani more flannel . no more plámás .
tough must be combin with effici and substanc .
we have 3 million unemploy in the european union .
commission , tell me plea , what are we to do about it ?
we need to give our young peopl digniti .
in my opinion , complet the opposit is the case .
we have too much central and too much conform .
that is critic to the futur welfar of european citizen .
such a discus ha been conduct here in parliament .
that is what the council will do .
the debat is close .
written statement ( rule 149 )
this is an ambit which i strong share .
thank you also to mr ashton for her measur speech .

this morn we adopt the gál report .
i shall not go back over the sakharov prize .
i have alreadi express my opinion .
mani non-believ are also persecut throughout the world .
there is no mention of trade unionist .
there is no mention of colombia either .
i hope that this debat will enabl u to make progress .
what about the forc deport of rom from franc this year ?
the second matter is about the union .
there is no disput over valu or object .
where do we stand on this ?
we must stick to the fact to remain credibl a an institut .
my specif concern in this regard is religi freedom ' .
action point for europ : lift the hous arrest on dr fan .
in those countri , the extremist are leav no stone unturn .
they are univers .
yet the univers of that respect is fail across the world .
that still exist .
i think we need more than that .
we look to you , baro ashton , to bring those forward .
the public are now bamboozl by this human right fest .
this ha to stop .
we must take specif measur .
( pl ) madam presid , i am plea by two thing .
i must say they realli do some great work .
out of curio , whi do you alway sit next to the council ?
set up your servic .
he ha now been imprison for 3 370 day .

the question is how we will use this instrument .
are these human right import to our partner ?
i am go to respond on three particular area .
i am not suggest that is what the eu ha done befor .
but i do not want it to sit in a corner .
it is the respons of everybodi .
that is the first thing to say .
we will pick that point up in that convers .
the second point wa about the breadth of the issu .
they belong to everybodi .
the debat is close .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 .

a new strategi for afghanistan ( debat )
the answer to this paradox is not simpl .
this report doe not tri to simplifi all these matter .
european valu and principl matter .
violent extrem extend beyond the region .
without that , there will not be a solut .
it set a good exampl for mani other donor too .
but there is alway room for improv intern coordin .
we need to do more and we need to do it better .
on the civilian side , we had the success kabul confer .
it wa not the usual roll-cal of request and donor pledg .
we need to encourag them to take such a long-term view .
third , should power be entrust to the moder taliban ?
our strategi includ good propos .
we approv it key messag : there will be no militari solut .
the war is have a huge cost .

afghanistan can not do without reliabl administr .
the drug problem can not be suppress with crop .
the un crop programm ha fail in practic .

( fr ) madam presid , i wish briefli to say three thing .
third , there is the question of polit dialogu .
this is not new .
i person believ that dialogu is necessari .
this is what act both respons and democrat is all about .
that would ruin our credibl .
that ha been veri well demonstr by the discus today .
i will conclud by again thank mr arlacchi for the report .
that is veri typic of him .
how i will miss him .
i just want to make a coupl of observ .
that wa the origin text .
this part of the report ha been chang by the amend .
the most import issu is drone .
this is not a report on drone .
i thank you , and i also thank baro ashton .

thank you veri much , and i wish you fruit work .

written statement ( rule 149 )
we must support the fundament messag of this report .
i call for the withdraw of foreign troop from afghanistan .
outcom of the nato summit in lisbon ( debat )
i wa veri plea to have particip in some of it discus .
nato is a key strateg partner for the european union .
my ambit is to pave the way to even more progress .
just to give a coupl of concret exampl .
similar exercis are plan for the next four year .
we owe this to our personnel .
i believ that we need to develop this accord .
a global nato , or a nato with a global role , is a must .
certain consequ are impli .
let me demonstr this use some exampl .
one exampl is arm expenditur .
a second exampl is nuclear disarma .
the third exampl is peacebuild and civil conflict resolut .
the european union ha achiev a great deal in this area .
then along come nato and also want to be involv .
unfortun , it ha a split person in secur polici term .
let u bring this to an end .
i welcom coordin between the two .
i also support nato enlarg to georgia and ukrain one day .
these are deepli danger .
today the british harrier jet is remov from servic .
madam presid , i would like to welcom baro ashton here .
i think you have an opportun to start anew .
i think this is an import issu .
the eu defenc minist have touch on a sore point .
the eu doe not have adequ capac or capabl .
the term share ' and pool ' describ what is now need .
do you share my view ?
i also have someth to say about elect observ .
in this area we are inconsist and sometim even coward .
you now have the opportun to say someth on this subject .
we do not , therefor , agre with this philosophi .
these are not matter requir a militari respons .
it is insuffici , although it goe in the right direct .
could we have expect more ?
henc both are come closer , henc complementar is grow .
whi not use it ?
do the sum and you will see .
i am talk about hospit cost usd ten million each .
doe anyon believ that ?
where doe this absurd road lead ?
it lead to νατο .
you right note the success and progress of capabl develop .
let u stop scaremong with this notion of duplic .
the answer is obvious .
this is a great challeng for u .
it is good that it is be discus here .
we need to work on this .
howev , this is the general and optimist view .
it realli wa an import turn point and an import moment .
perhap europ can handl it even more effect .
howev , the momentum of enlarg ha weaken .
militari contribut have decreas alarm .
true , the soviet union ha collaps .
it may be taken a a declar of goodwil .
i think that we need to take this into account .
it is inde for member state to come forward with idea .
i hope and expect to see more of that in the futur .
the debat is close .

if the council is involv , parliament is involv .
we are codecis maker , colegisl in this regard .

we can not accept the prior exclus of deleg act .
ahead of u lie a number of difficult year , without doubt .
this regul will definit not come to a decis on this .
this is decid in the basic act .
my second point concern the critic of articl 10 .

that is go to be a fact .
we have a 12-month lay cycl .
i know what i want this parliament and the commiss to say .
no derog and no extens .
after all , produc have had ten year to compli .
it is no excus to say that we were not awar it wa come .

it will be veri difficult to stop .
unstamp egg are a gift to a fraudul trader .
we have learnt this the hard way in the uk .
what a glare inconsist .
the regul ha put about 15 penc on a dozen egg .
egg from illeg cage will undercut those who obey the eu .
he did the right thing .
is the commiss go to reneg and make his egg uncompetit ?
the recent crise show where this can lead u .
public confid in the eu is at an all-tim low .
it is not time to play chicken with the egg farmer .
did you say that 66 % of product is now free-rang ?
that is not the inform i have .
they want them .
rememb that , folk .
that is the fact of the situat .
let me address the market situat .
moral and ethic , we can not dump those egg .
we need some answer from the commiss .

i do not think we can backtrack on this .
the languag is hard suggest of uniform sever enforc .
word like proportion ' and dissuas ' have been use .
our produc are demand protect from unfair competit .
should we not take that into account ?

written statement ( rule 149 )
i want to add one final point .
no deliveri of feed fat were made outsid of germani .
what ha the commiss done to help manag the incid ?
the german author are inform and have agre to this visit .
we can not allow this to happen .
this is unaccept .
what action are you intend to take , then ?
respons is still the best guardian of secur .
they then evad liabil and farmer and consum pay the price .
whi do we not appli target check there ?
we need to ensur that this is the case .
if they are , they should be prosecut for it .
let u not simpli go wholesal and bring in new legisl .
let u implement what we have .
state check are rare carri out on feed and food produc .
the contamin would then have been detect in time .
how do you intend to implement that commission ?
we need to be faster in this regard in general .
the valu were a maximum of four time too high .
thus , there is no acut risk ; it is a matter of precaut .
it did not , howev .
it happen right here in the european union .
the peopl of europ have been shown their reflect .
individu are increas resort to crimin mean and method .
howev , we will all lose out in the end a a result .
we must final tackl the caus of this problem .
that is unaccept .
i hope that the agricultur council will comment on this .
howev , there is also a need for monitor and surveil .
this should be done in a proportion way .
we need more monitor of those do the monitor .
that is too few and we need to increas that number .
ladi and gentleman , today we see how well it is do .
they do not break down .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
agricultur ha becom an industri .
it is a model which doe not guarante food safeti .
we ought to support this .
there seem to be ani number of food scandal .
in my view , howev , this is not a matter for the eu .
we have the strongest consum protect system in the world .
consum need to bear that in mind right now .
he said that , essenti , the system work .
obvious , we know that the system ha gone wrong .
that is not where the problem lie .
this will not work .
i hope that europ can take inspir from this law .
there are still thing that need to be done in this area .
abov all , we need to put a stop to the self-control test .
a consum , we do not want to eat contamin food .
i would therefor like to put two question to the commiss .
even one contamin of anim feed is unaccept .
the exist of thousand of farmer is current under threat .
we need to find solut to this quick .
this is not the first dioxin scare .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
what is it that we need ?
consum are current be deliber misl .
studi quit clear show that peopl would be happi to pay .
second , we need more stringent check .
i have three other point to make .
it is not rocket scienc .
cut cost is about cut corner .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
i would ask that we truli learn from this scandal .
this rais a number of veri serious concern .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
i do not believ that we should make them stricter .
we simpli have to make them function better .
third , we need tougher penalti for the crimin .
this is not a minor offenc - it wa done with intent .
i believ that that is the current realiti of the situat .
here , i would like to comment on the rapid alert system .
we also need to strengthen our rule and regul .
we must ensur that this incid is now kept under control .
the debat is close .

we need leaner , simplifi procedur .
we need to promot the famili .
this is an import debat .
this is a dream for those child who grow up in institut .
i assum that the commiss will take the lead in this work .
intern adopt is just one option .
this explain the larg number of child in care home .
howev , 22 966 child do have a parent .
therefor , these child are not elig for adopt .
this also appli to the 22 285 child in foster care .
the second step is to combat child traffick and prostitut .
my countri will never accept such an abomin again .
thus , the eu should not reinvent the wheel in this area .
i welcom the commission 's statement in this regard .
now we have anoth initi .
i would like to warn veri strong against this .
the overview of the practic is at least a import a legisl .
exact what kind of data are we collect about this topic ?
what method do we use ?
how do we supervis the prepar process ?
do we have common rule for this ?
what are the differ in member state practic ?
do adopt parent receiv continu profession support ?
is reliabl and regular follow-up avail ?
such famili should be help .
give help , and do not take child from their famili .
clear , these child are our prioriti .
child deserv the best .
first of all , this mean that they deserv a famili .
this appli twice over to intern adopt .
our attitud to adopt have chang utter .
certain , the birth famili are veri import in all of this .
europ should provid a coordin role .
i am hope that the referendum will happen .
the situat will certain improv then .
mani though , get this with their adopt parent .
this is a tragic situat which our democraci can not toler .
the liberalis of intern adopt entail numer risk .
hundr of child are be illeg adopt or put up for trade .

i would like to call for evid of this to be seen , too .
i am therefor look forward to the respons .
that repli explain a great deal .
no , the problem wa polit .
the problem is that there is a lack of polit will .
therefor , our group take a clear posit on this matter .
we must not throw good money after bad .
we saw mani illeg dump site and burn pile of rubbish .
what are the deadlin ?
where doe the european commiss stand on this ?
obvious , the mafia , too , clear ha a hand in this .
how can member state help each other here ?
sinc then , the situat ha chang .
they are the one sound the alarm about the full landfil .
this ha been especi true over the last few year .
the court found against itali - again , quit right so .
itali did not meet the deadlin .
we keep come back to the same situat .
it is a scandal .
it will not do .
enough ha seep away alreadi .
it would be wrong to consid impos further penalti .
there are no excus , howev .
i know what i am talk about .
quit honest , i would set four condit .
first , a wast manag plan must be drawn up .
it seem this ha now been done .
howev , the commiss should also assist in this .
there can be no deni the will and commit shown by itali .
the offer made by the eu is good , comprehens and fair .
we should also encourag the local author to do this .
we should make this deal with each other and work togeth .
the situat is critic ; there is no quick fix .
it is not easi but it is more than need .
i want to be help strict and strict help .
the idea is certain not to impos fine .
that is my sincer hope .
it is a new direct which wa recent adopt .
that is the fundament and most import need .
i can assur you that we will do it also in the futur .

in my opinion , there is a need to take decis action .
this mean that it is still under discus .
the commiss is continu to look into this matter .
you will rememb this .
that will happen in spring of this year .
it is veri clear that the union can interven here .
this is subsidiar .
we must not mix thing up .
it is for the member state to defin what marriag is .
these are two complet differ thing .
we will see , but that is what he predict .
we must take action to stop this .
we must take action .
this is a poison slander , design to confus and mislead .

i believ a new realiti is emerg .
the market want it .
our intern partner want it .

i think we are speak the same languag on this issu .
push hard for this , let u not give in !
the budget debat is onli just begin .
we will not succeed by reduc resourc .
opportun have been miss again .
they are inappropri or non-exist .
let u recognis the possibl of failur .
mr farag is nod .
let u act , for heaven 's sake !
just think what would happen if this revis were to fail .
therein lie my second point : much ado about noth .
you are chang the treati for a point of law .
veri well , let u speed up !
i would like the council to speed up , mr van rompuy .
parliament ha alreadi present it report .
that is the current state of affair .
what should our next step be ?
i would like to endors fulli what mr goulard ha said .
the long-term solut doe not lie in bigger govern .
the stake are high .
no , it is not failur ' - although it could be .
it is stabil ' , is it not ?
mr barroso use it , mr van rompuy use it : stabil ' .
your reassur that all is well do not work .
who do you think you are kid , mr van rompuy ?
bond yield in portug rose to near 7 % yesterday .
nobodi believ you .
the public doe not support you .
i hope and pray the market break you .
mr barroso say : choos sustain growth ' .
what if it doe not work ?
move then to creat the condit for growth and employ .
how should we go about that ?
and so what doe the european union do ?
reward the netherland by spend even more .
do you rememb ask for a 6 % budget increas for the eu ?
mr presid , the eu can not be trust .
would that have improv the current situat in europ ?
no economist would agre with you on that , mr farag .
you can not simpli say that we are live in the past .
we are deal now with issu that concern europ today .
you ask me what my solut is today .
it is absolut a plain a a pikestaff .
greec , portug and ireland do not fit insid the euro .
regard eurobond , mani issu have been set out here today .
i would just like to add two more .
were they capabl of provid a panel of emin person ?
you have been ask to manag the euro crisi .
this is the real issu at stake here today .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
let the medium and analyst be under no illus .
the eu will introduc all that is need , when it is need .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
ha the council taken stock of it achiev ?
is this the purpos of the euro area ?
we can see that econom potenti in itself is not suffici .
this is a question that i put to you .
obvious , the unit state of america is print new money .
it is veri odd that it should be weak on these matter .
regrett , though , noth is happen .
if they are , they will be seen a hero .
we have seen that threat in this debat today .
the task we have in front of u is extrem difficult .
this is the realiti .
we need it .
i said it yesterday , i reaffirm it today .
onc again , let me make clear the posit of the commiss .
some of u would like to go further .
final , i think everybodi ha to make a contribut .
so how should we do it ?
that is an import thing , that is a question of credibl .
this is inde someth that market are ask of u .
i apologis for appear posit everi now and then .
unemploy is fall in some countri .
who would have believ that in 2008 or in 2009 ?
onc upon a time , it wa 0.85 .
at that time , no one said that the euro wa at risk .
i want to highlight this befor move on to other point .
we virtual had to make them up on the spot .
we had noth , though .
there wa a stabil and growth pact which wa not observ .
there wa no macro-econom oversight .
some of you have said , it is too littl , too late ' .
it is a worthi explan .
look at develop on the market ' .
clear , reform are often pain .
this is extrem urgent .
ha structur econom growth been forgotten ?
there is an agenda - a clear agenda .
can we go faster ?
a i said , there were two obstacl .
that is far more import than progress made separ .
we will get there by this gradual , progress approach .
i am convinc that we are head in the right direct .
i am convinc that there is a common will .
i am convinc that we will make it in the end .

do you think that mr nixon found the waterg inform balanc ?
obvious not !
of cours not !
of cours not !
inform should upset polit .
it upset u , too , and sometim that hurt .
you say that you want a strong europ , prime minist orbán .
how are we go to have discus with china ?
they all want balanc inform .
a democraci never die from have too mani freedom .
you knew that twenti year ago .
you see , then , that what i am tell you is right .
i want to finish on one thing , prime minist orbán .
we are with you for the world 's christian .
( applaus )
discharg civil servant without state the reason .
an excess , discrimin , and structur distort crisi tax .
support to the wealthi to the detriment of the poor .

populist hack , a though go at a botan garden with an axe .
destruct of the fine fabric of societi , of it solidar .
now we are face the risk of the veri opposit .
this would truli be a shame .
i , a a hungarian , will have none of this shame .
it is not too late to revers our direct .
i would just like to make one point .
this is not interfer in hungarian affair .
this situat must remain unchang .
this doe not onli relat to hungari .
i believ that this is veri import .
wake up mr orbán .
look at how they are tri to bulli you this morn .
they are tri to tell you how to run your own countri .
tell them where to go .
stand up and fight for democraci onc again .
at that time , this wa our histor mission .
and now it is the same .
in today 's world , lie and oppress rest on two pillar .
i have two question for you .
howev , whether that suit mr orbán is anoth matter .
are you awar of this ?
you have complet forgotten about the origin ideal .
what he said about justic is no longer refer to here .
you are the greatest oppressor of the work peopl .
this is one thing .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
our european valu repres respons .
this is also proven by it object .
i agre with the titl of the programm .
prime minist , you are a man of purpos .
we last met at his funer servic in decemb 2009 .
your second argument is that the critic is unspecif .
that is what the crimin law is there for .
plea let the crimin law take effect in this case .
there are mani specif point .
there is no place for retreat here .
we are fail to do that !
no one in europ , mr schulz least of all , is defend them .
those are the simpl fact of the matter .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
doe that seem like cultur to you ?
is it a dignifi present of proud hungari ?
they are in an honour place , adorn the presid 's tabl .
we , too , disagre with it .
this is whi i see this a a doubl standard .
the elector ha given you a clear mandat to do this .
this is exact what you are do .
this hypocrit approach must not gain a major in this hous .
( applaus )
i do not think that this is what you want .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
( the presid interrupt the speaker )
welcom to the european parliament , mr orbán .
in conclus , i wish u all good luck .
where a singl polit parti domin , other voic grow silent .

it is not the first time you have done this , though .
i will end by draw your attent to croatia .
you want it to join .
we are in favour of that .
do not forget that you were minist for justic .
i wish you best of luck for these tremend task .
tave bahtalo !
in europ , we have freedom of the press .
instead it should take rapid , decis and effect action .
it ha not yet done this .
we thought you were a liber .
i can imagin that this doe not alway feel good .
that is what i would like to ask you .
i hope that you will succeed in your object .
i take the liberti of disagre with mr cohn-bendit .
this is import and it is also the right thing to do .
( applaus )
we can not accept thing move in this direct .
we can not allow it to continu .
that ha not alway been the case previous .
next , move to the four prioriti of the hungarian presid .
growth and job .
what specif action are you go to take on that ?
the second prioriti is a stronger europ .
we in europ are current up to our neck in water .
this tax is contrari to the intern market .
when will it be abolish ?
mutati mutandi , someth similar is take place today .
this is appar in the context of the medium law .
the two are not the same .
the first is the croatia question .
i wa assign to teach two of my classmat german .
i know all about the signific of the revolut .
( applaus )
everyon must learn to live with their histori .
that is hungari 's medium law .
the process of make europ stronger begin at home .
our weak are nation , egoism , polaris and protection .
i wish the presid all the best for the next six month .
[ applaus ]
first , i will don the hat of hungarian prime minist .
and the list could go on and on and on .
so much for factual accuraci .
i am shock to see how much you are live in the past .
i wa here and heard it with my own ear .
what are you protest against ?
i wa here and heard it with my own ear !
what is this if not an insult to the hungarian peopl ?
this is not a matter of medium law !
both problem need to be address .
let me tell you that this will all depend on you .
not that we are happi about it , of cours .
i am well awar that we will be have serious polit debat .
thank you for honour me with your attent .
mr schulz ha ask to make such a person statement .
( murmur of dissent )
( de ) mr presid , mr orbán , you have address me person .
no one who criticis a law is insult the hungarian peopl .
you can be sure of one thing .
( applaus )
we can not creat a success europ by dismemb it .
do not play one off against the other .
( applaus )

are you mobilis the extrem right ?
you are right to do so .
this is unworthi of the european union , mr orbán .

we all wish you a success presid .
romania ha made major financi and human effort .

it is normal to expect a repli in line with eu rule .
therefor , dialogu remain an essenti tool .
do we realli need second-class european citizen ?
sport is one of the prioriti of the hungarian presid .
sport also mean lower healthcar cost .
the map in question is that of europ in 1848 .

alzheim 's diseas affect everywher equal .
frequent , the burden of care fall on famili member .
this figur is like to doubl virtual everi 20 year .
in franc , there are 160 000 new suffer each year .
alzheim 's diseas is a major challeng to european societi .
it is import to act in a global way .
a yet , no cure ha been found for alzheim 's diseas .
a new case is diagnos everi 24 second .
these comment should be includ in the polici a well .
better coordin between the member state is essenti too .
a a result , we will be face with a major challeng .
the process ha still not been complet .
in summari , this is the reason for my vote .
if a product ha a ce mark , then it fulfil these requir .
in write . - with the adopt of this resolut , the ep :
this status quo ha to be chang !
europ , in turn , can launch a similar programm for haiti .
more than a million peopl are still homeless .
the major in parliament ha said noth about these fact .
action must be taken to ensur long-term develop in haiti .
in write . - haiti is again a matter of urgenc .
if natur destroy , peopl rebuild .
these word must inspir u to make an ever greater commit .
this homophob hysteria must stop .
this is unaccept .
i welcom it and it certain ha my vote .

it must not remain silent on this issu .
we must not accept violent discrimin or act of terror .
we can not talk about minor in this case .
howev , there is also intoler between differ muslim group .
but let u not be mistaken .
terror is polit and terror is a crime .
urgent reaction is need .
this hous fight for the right of peopl to emigr .
god can not want forc observ .
it is not onli a matter of extrem , howev .
convers to christian is forbidden or even punish by death .
we are now about to adopt the agreement on iraq .
our determin to defend them should be no le .
for other they are valu in their own right .
it is time for action .
i have two specif question for mr ashton .
freez those agreement , put them on ice this veri day !
we therefor natur condemn blasphemi .
we believ that this resolut is a step in the wrong direct .
the uk or franc ?
no , the same problem exist there , a well ' .
this is an acid test of our european spiritu valu .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
our sympathi also goe to their friend and famili .
this must lie at the heart of our bilater relationship .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
today , howev , eastern christian communiti need protect .
it should not be afraid to say the word ...
( the presid cut off the speaker )
no one should be persecut becaus of their religi belief .
this incid is now be consid by the un .
the iie requir signific capac in this area .
concret action is need .
wake up , wretch europ , and rememb your christian root !
the victim need to be given face .
the victim need to be present in our european institut .
this is paragraph 2 of our resolut .
what can we do ?
we can not let terrorist use religion a a tool of barbar .
europ is a mosaic : it uniti and diver are our motto .
ha the turkish repres to the european union been call in ?
if not , whi not ?
so let u not make this a motion against anybodi .
it is for christian and for those who are be attack .
they think it an anachron .
it is time we start to have mutual respect .
we are do this among ourselv .
sometim , this is obvious not the case .
you can count on the solidar of parliament in that regard .
iraq , iran , egypt , nigeria , turkey , pakistan .
in northern iraq , peopl are afraid to adorn their home .
where have we got to with this ?
those respons are most fanat islam extremist .
it is pure hate .
it need to be stop and it must be stop .
elsewher in the world , too , there are challeng .
we want to isol religion in a privat space .
secular is not the answer to these problem .
this is not a seri of regrett but uncoordin attack .
on the contrari , it is classic mass persecut .
but this is not about number .
it is about liberti and ident .
we do not speak about new minor there .
this is not oppos one religion against anoth .
colleagu , we now come to the catch-the-ey procedur .
turkey must be condemn for it crime within eu territori .
the eu must not remain passiv .
christian in cyprus are in danger .
we also have problem in europ .
this is precis the problem of our communiti today .
we must not be toler of intoler .
i want to just pick up two or three thing .
we have fund anti-discrimin ngo in some 60 countri .

this also includ the immedi releas of all polit detaine .
ladi and gentleman , you are a well awar of this a i am .

brussel must not abandon minsk now .

inde , we said we would wait for the decemb elect .
belarus should be suspend .
our onli partner should be civil societi .
belarus wa use to block euronest .
it realli should not be like this .
all of those hope have been dash .
fortun , ladi ashton seem to be on the right track .
so far , this programm ha not exact live up to it promis .
the post-communist regim ha becom unbear .
i hope that she ha put her headphon on again .
let u now get down to busi , commission .
this is true .
this is a matter where both type of measur should be link .
it is not onli about belarus .
ladi ashton said that we should continu help .
we should discontinu do a littl a we did in the past .
did we do all that we should have done ?
i also admir the concept that you have produc .
the respons to their action wa unjustifi .
they should be awar that they have our solidar .
the citizen of belarus should be welcom into the union .
the elect were unfair .
lukashenko is lead the countri and the opposit is in gaol .
we speak of polit prison who must be releas .

gaddafi is the fidel castro of africa .
we must also address the sensit issu of the death penalti .
libya put pressur on london and edinburgh .
gaddafi : islam must becom the religion of europ ' .
gaddafi want to launch a jihad against switzerland .
they should be sent straight back to africa .
incident , it is also a disgrac that saudi arabia doe too .
libya 's leader is a master of caprici and unreli .
human digniti is more import than money .
the italian except must not becom the european rule .
are these the base on which agreement should be conduct ?
we can not deal with either terrorist or dictat .
it wa arm for prison .
that wa arm for border .
this is arm for bond .
chine foreign exchang reserv are usd 2.9 trillion .
it ha alreadi bought greek , spanish and portugues bond .
this mean share it equal between the member state .
let u have no misconcept .
they are onli interest in hard financi fact .

i categor reject this opinion .
the eu is play an activ role in arctic issu .
planet , peopl and product .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
that is whi they need to be listen to .
no one ha the right to rape and plunder that region .
we need to prepar for these respons .

today , our polici in the area can be further develop .
some peopl would say that the black sea is a small sea .
let me mention just two of the recommend in the report .
sinc the latest enlarg , the black sea is also an eu sea .
we have to tackl this new respons resolut .
to my mind , there are two main reason for this .
all must tread care here .
the black sea area is russia 's backyard .
turkey ha just 4 % of it landmass within europ .
it should not be in the eu .
there are real danger in lead turkey on .
tread care inde .
it still ha this signific in our time .
so i call upon the commiss to act .
this will provid effect help in modernis the area .
this need to be done now .
one such issu is maritim secur .
we can not resolv region conflict , either .
they want to work with u .
i propos we begin this cooper and act togeth with other .
what doe that mean ?
at some point , we need to set a time limit .
do we have a supplier or not ?
the second one is energi secur itself .
the black sea offer a great opportun .
what is key in this respect is cooper .
the debat is close .

the eastern partnership can play a signific role here .
over 600 peopl were arrest and imprison .
anyon arrest for polit reason should be releas immedi .
the eu ha not recognis the offici poll result .

both report refer to the black sea synergi ' .
the common fisheri polici ha fail .
noth new emerg from this report .

the black sea region is a strateg area for europ .
it is there that they understand the region 's polit best .
we should look after this partnership .

the propos for the danub strategi wa drawn up in 2006 .
the black sea can contribut to the develop of the danub .
both region are interdepend .
the issu that could bring an immedi result is energi .
this text is an imperialist manifesto .
it is an inflammatori text , and i shall vote against it .

eu recognit of the rom genocid dure world war ii
unfortun , not all european are awar of this fact .
educ is the best way to fight discrimin .
today we are speak up for our rom brother and sister .
their name were array on a larg plaqu .
i thought i would take it out and take it home a a relic .
at that point my son , józsi , said :
`` i do n't care , my son , ” said i .
i faint and wa taken out of the crematorium . '
whi is it import to rememb ?
should we not concern ourselv with the futur instead ?
men and woman , elder peopl and child .
mani , mani child .
but this is still the past , ' one could say .
where is the futur in this ? '
therefor we have to speak about this .
let u all fight togeth the ghost of the past .
this wa the first-ev polici document dedic specif to rom .
we should be content with noth le .
they are still discrimin against and prejudic still exist .
( applaus )
we actual do not know the exact figur .
howev , we can not just stop at this .
mr presid , i speak here this afternoon with deep feel .
their histori is our histori , too .
there is still a long way to go .
the second largest group were pole .
he wrote : 'i have found my parent again .
we are be transport to the concentr camp .
thank you onc again for everyth that you have done for me .
greet to you all .
see you in heaven .
robert . '
we need the whole truth about this chapter of histori .
i would propos a more ration approach .
the debat is close .
written statement ( rule 149 )
the best form of commemor is to look to the futur .
they are free , equal european citizen .
let u begin with the matter of energi .
energi secur is a prioriti for all of u .
we also still have regulatori task ahead of u .
all this must be fund primarili by the privat sector .
foreign relat are also of except import in energi polici .
let u move on to the topic of innov .
not from credit , sinc that is not someth we want .
we want to stop debt , after all .
energi and innov : invest point toward the futur .
we are in a delic situat .
this is an import point to make in the current context .
it could also creat two million job by 2020 .
our competitor know this , they are alreadi bet on innov .
and a well a maintain spend , we need to spend better .
but it will not avoid discus the economi .
the annual growth survey wa well receiv .
the messag were focus and clear .
i would like to thank the hungarian presid .
the commiss will be particular attent to these issu .
what headlin will the major newspap run ?
they were the one that set themselv this object .
i will therefor limit myself to two essenti element .
( applaus )
well , it is better late than never .
( applaus )
i am disturb by the absenc of europ in a histor process .
you make your statement mr barroso - excel .
mr van rompuy make his statement - that is also excel .
baro ashton make a statement - great .
we must not wast the opportun that we have here .
they want secular .
they want civil democraci .
these are our partner .
( applaus )
that would be a posit and encourag signal .
i have to say that the commiss 's letter wa excel .
this should not happen in europ .
( applaus )
it is not compat with the audiovisu medium servic direct .
that ha been state veri eleg by mr kroe herself .
quit frank , i find it both disappoint and embarrass .
the u is invest huge amount of money in green technolog .
( the presid briefli interven on a procedur matter )
china is invest heavili in research and new technolog .
today china ha more than 400 photovolta compani .
ten year ago they had zero per cent of the world market .
now they have 23 % .
ten year ago they had zero per cent of the wind market .
they have 50 % now .
what are we do in europ ?
that is where we are compar to china and the u .
so the bank are move .
now , where is the european leadership ?
the council is haggl about the energi target .
that is where we stand .
where were you then ?
what is keep the fidesz govern from do so ?
i wa in hungari quit often between 2002 and 2010 .
i will not tell you what these demonstr remind me of .
a a german i will not go into that here .
( applaus )
the situat is come to a head .
( applaus )
this summit is actual suppos to be an energi summit .
i have simpli lost patienc with this now .
( applaus )
germani now seem to be follow the schäubl cours .
we need more than a minor amend to the stabil instrument .
we are complet oppos to that !
what we need in this council is an energi revolut .
and this realli rais the big question .
now we have the north african crisi .
the price of oil is alreadi rise .
we face the most horrifi scenario of lose the suez canal .
so , a for egypt , for all of u : order transit .
otherwis we are go to have huge problem .
that is correct .
that is absurd .
it can not be evalu accord to such a criterion .
you are absolut right .
what is the reason for this ?
moreov , the state will not be abl to bear this cost alon .
that is exact the point .
first , let u do what we have alreadi commit ourselv to .
we are fair good , but not good enough .
take action ; do someth - here and now .
that is not good econom , especi in a time of crisi .
so much for how import they think it is to listen to u .
onli the netherland is support him .
this is a consider victori and renew will continu .
that is the number one energi of the futur .
we ought to discus this with the council a well .
this bring me on to the subject of research and innov .
eur 53 billion have been earmark for the period 2007-2013 .
what stage have we reach ?
mr barroso said : le red tape ' .
he is quit right .
final , how are we to structur our european space ?
this is anoth item that the council ought not to ignor .
howev , we should be pragmat a well a ambiti .
the time ha come to wake up .
a great tecton chang is take place befor our eye .
oil now cost usd 100 again .
where are we ?
what are the strateg question ?
that is an innov summit .
these are two vital sector for capit .
i believ that we do not have time to wast .
howev , the council is engag in the wrong debat .
well , he is wrong about that .
product mean sourc , transport and distribut .
new transport rout can be creat in this region .
energi effici is a must .
nor can it ignor the financi and econom crisi .
these measur requir great sacrific from famili and busi .
a for the eu , is it do what it should ?
i do not think so .
we have had enough figur and report .
we now have to move forward and make progress .
the second point , obvious , is innov .
the minist ha also suggest that .
i wish you success .
second , regard energi , we need energi effici .
we have a lot of programm in order to achiev that .
that is one way of use energi sourc effici .
phase out nuclear power is hinder u .
i can not see ani determin , sincer or dynam .
time is run out .
we urgent need more courag to have more europ .
the event requir new act of solidar .
they requir the next step to be taken toward integr .
thank you for your attent .
we did miss someth , howev , which nobodi ha notic .
now whi should this be ?
whatev could be the explan ?
well i am afraid i am stuck for an answer .
if you would allow me one final thought , mr presid .
this european council on energi realli is veri import .
i listen veri care to our mep from the baltic countri .
we all know that the cleanest energi is safe energi .
the economi will , of cours , be discus a well .
of cours , plea encourag u to do more in this field .
the same for innov .
the modif of the legisl could be consid ' .
we are readi .
the debat is close .
written statement ( rule 149 )
we can not afford a two-spe europ in the field of energi .
thank you .
thank you .
there are current 27 energi market oper in the eu .
they treat the will of parliament with contempt .
the eu must do someth .
europ should integr it forc in this area too .
i am go to begin by talk about tunisia .
i plan to travel to tunisia the week after next .
i will now address the situat in egypt .
we are concern that live ammunit may also have been use .
( applaus )
whi , baro ashton , ha europ react so feebli ?
in point of fact , we have hard react at all .
( applaus )
i believ that europ ha made two mistak in recent day .
well , let me tell you that i am not afraid .
( applaus )
quit the contrari , they are revolut for freedom .
( applaus )
( applaus )
mr presid , baro ashton , you are appeal for calm .
howev , call a spade a spade !
so , do not appeal for everyon to be calm .
no , emphat not .
then there will be calm in cairo .
now , today , it is possibl .
you are a last-minut resist fighter .
that make everyth clear .
you can tell u .
this parliament ha the right to know .
well , inshallah !
this whole situat remind me of iran .
plea tread care in handl north africa .
this part of the world is not europ .
the question is : can you not recal what happen in iran ?
do you not see ani similar ?
( the presid cut off the speaker )
( applaus )
today we see a worri trend toward violenc .
( applaus )
but that is not the issu here .
you may have some explain to do later on .
( laughter )
there are risk a well a hope .
there are certain lesson to be learnt from iran .
peopl expect chang and they expect aid without string .
the ea repres there said that it wa spent on reform .
what reform ?
can we have some truth answer ?
bewar : democraci doe not mean elect .
it mean much , much more than this .
i have been told this mani time within the european union .
presid mubarak ha to leav , that ha to be made clear .
we must shoulder our respons in this matter .
( applaus )
i did not say we have fail to accept polit islam ' !
we have pave the way for certain terrorist !
democraci can be built with extrem diver parti .
let u not throw the babi out with the bath water .
( applaus )
let u speak togeth .
that could be a feminist agenda for you .
( applaus )
the situat is in constant flux and is hard to predict .
let u therefor be prudent in our choic of partner .
( applaus )
howev , we should nevertheless tri to do so .
we support a dirti regim .
that is what happen here .
we need peac in the middl east .
we therefor need to speak and express our opinion clear .
that is what this parliament expect .
this is truli the time for human right .
howev , there are also risk that we must face up to .
( nl ) mr presid , baro ashton , stop be so naïv .
mr guy verhofstadt , stop be naïv , a well .
baro ashton , you have not said a singl word about that .
becaus islam and democraci can not coexist .
democraci doe not just pop up in an unfertil field .
( nl ) mr presid , i can onli agre with mr deva .
we need to act decis on this .
europ need to show greater polit matur .
to do this , we need to retun europ 's polit antenna .
it did not do so .
mr blair also warn against a rush to elect in egypt .
what do you think about the statement of toni blair ?
madam presid , i am conclud .
what is happen in egypt ha come a a surpris to u all .
the impact of this can not be underestim .
these are weak parti .
we know where that ha led .
in the case of tunisia , howev , we still have time .
their right and the eu 's credibl are tie .
thank you veri much .
today i am quit sure of this .
go to cairo befor the council of foreign minist .
speak with the govern repres and with the opposit there .
a revolut is take place there .
it is a revolut against the dictatorship and for freedom .
madam presid , this moment ha been a long time come .
well , that is right , but it is not enough .
high repres , this is not a time for limp wrist .
in my opinion , there are two thing that need to be done .
second , we must ask ourselv where we went wrong .
where wa the mediterranean union in all of this ?
histori demand it of u .
the union 's visibl ha been in no way compar .
do we want to be a major global player ?
i think there are ground for self-critic .
it is still not too late .
tunisia and egypt serv a exampl for other .
everyon know of other in the region .
mani peopl are afraid to mention them by name .
this situat requir polit leadership by the high repres .
howev , the 27 do not have differ interest .
presid mubarak is for u a friend . '
today he call for a transit .
final , i agre with baro ashton , our high repres .
these are not valu that we are impos from europ .
it is alreadi time for mubarak to go ; his time ha pas .
he wast the time he had .
my thought are also with the victim .
it must implement a strong strategi toward these countri .
it is clear that they do exist .
elect result in these countri provid clear evid .
totalitarian regim do not spring up overnight .
unfortun , we are among the last to adopt a common posit .
is it not the same kind of hypocrisi ?
rais your voic .
how to react then ?
what kind of regim will result ?
that , howev , is not the point i want to make right now .
there is a great deal of work here for you , baro ashton .
be ambiti and we will support you .
presid mubarak must step down now .
chang is alreadi happen in these countri .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
we should be under no illus .
we were ahead of everyon el .
neither do i accept that we were slow to act .
i do not accept that we have not done enough .
i do accept that there is more that we can do .
probabl not .
did you give me all the resourc i need ?
i am not somebodi who can go out and give my person view .
i speak for the european union .
when i speak to him i speak on behalf of europ .
that mean someth to these peopl .
we are say the same thing .
we must not lose sight of that in anyth el that we do .
i have been say it for a long time .
i am tri to do it .
it is a process .
that is what europ offer .
it brought about transform that will last for generat .
that is what we are in the busi of .
we are not in the busi of knee-jerk reaction and respons .
i am watch what happen in jordan .
i am in touch there .
i am of cours engag in what is happen in iran .
i certain have not forgotten the middl east peac process .
i wa speak with georg mitchel yesterday .
we will see prime minist fayyad tomorrow .

in foreign polici , howev , this is seen a high contenti .
this is anoth reason whi this instrument is especi import .
so far , so good - or so it would seem .
what is this all about ?
we want to do what we see a our duti to our elector .
you know the situat .
i realli feel a sen of urgenc here .
parliament decid to react quick , and that is crucial .
yet we are also send a messag to the council .
the ball is now in the council 's court .
the european union made a commit to the acp countri .
( fr ) thank you for your question , lord dartmouth .
so far the eu instrument have not realli been adapt .
i should like to endors what mr brandtner said .
( pt ) madam presid , out with mubarak , now !
it must be under adequ parliamentari scrutini .
this is someth veri import .
this is put peopl 's live at risk .
let u make sure that this cooper continu in the futur .
we should make sure that we do so .
it is need today more than ever .
my question is this .
how can we do that ?
there is not enough bread and jam for all of them .
it is essenti for the european union to provid help .
such measur are subject to the comitolog system .
we are demand noth more and noth le than that .
from my point of view , the taxpay financ a budget .
i think that the opposit is the case .
we are not spend too much money .
on the contrari , we need much clearer financi support .
my apolog - i got held up in traffic .
twenty-two thousand .
the good news is that it use to be 34 000 .
this issu is about implement or deleg act .
these have not been accept by the council .
i can assur this hous that we have realli tri veri hard .
on these issu , there ha been no rapproch .
legal , our argument are sound .
they supplement the basic regul and are of general applic .
the council and parliament must have a veto right .
it is a legal oblig .
we demand to have our say on how this issu is address .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
i wa the rapporteur on the develop and cooper instrument .
i hope that the new regul will be future-proof .
the joint debat is close .
the vote will take place today at 11.30 .
wast electr and electron equip ( debat )
the process ha not been exact straightforward .
the european countri have vari collect rate .
everi countri is do what it want and use it own definit .
sometim we seem to have forgotten that .
we are right to defin the collect target more clear .
we are right to put a stop to illeg export .
the exampl i can give would make your hair stand on end .
this is whi we want a more dedic collect system .
that is our main goal .
the system must be brought up-to-d and made more attract .
we are on the way to achiev this .
onli those element have been truli impact-assess .
i would like to start with a question for mr potočnik .
is this not a misinterpret of diver ?
this must not happen in futur .
you need to be stricter .
we need the member state to implement the regul proper .
this is extrem import .
first , i want to mention the cost .
the producer-pay ' principl is paramount .
this is an area that ha been sad neglect .
i look forward to that .
these are amend 101 and 102 .
this direct is part and parcel of that .
unfortun , in europ , today it is the except .
tomorrow it ha got to be the rule .
this also give u a chanc to finish some uncomplet busi .
but the printer compani found a way around that .
i look for the support of colleagu for those amend .
madam presid , i too enjoy my joust with mr davi .
i am stand up for hardwork taxpay .
that is the key .
you need to explain this .
my second point is a follow .
plea read the direct .
it say noth at all about taxpay have to fund the system .
in fact , this is the respons of the produc .
i would like to hear your respons to these two point .
we all know where the cost end up - where it alway doe .
you never tell peopl that you are go to put up tax .
that is fundament undemocrat and wrong .
member state are not just good or bad .
( hu ) madam presid , my apolog for hesit .
it is not a question of the cost of deal with this .
it is a question of pure profit .

implement of the servic direct ( debat )
this wa an import piec of polici .
the european commiss also agre to help u in this regard .
on the first point , i have the follow to say .
in some case , they are mere internet portal .
one issu here is the languag that is provid .
i expect the member state to respect that .
that is what i demand of the member state in this context .
mr presid , thank you for your welcom remark .
mr gebhardt spoke of lengthi discus here in parliament .
howev , servic are a key sourc of growth and employ .
it is still far too earli for that .
mani state have still not transpos it fulli or correct .
that is precis the reason for this own-in report .
first , the point of singl contact .
the second aspect concern the scope of the direct .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
this report ha therefor come at a veri opportun time .
so much for the reprimand .
allow me to name just three of them .
the verts/al group will therefor vote against this report .
it is do so on account of two key point .
we now need to realli make that work .
that is what the point of singl contact are all about .
we regret the absenc of this in the report .
i hope that you continu to receiv them .
i agre , but it also ha to be time .
where are we now , commission ?
if not , i think that is pathet .
that is short-sight .
it is not wait for u .
you can count on receiv support from our imco committe .
unfortun , this is not yet happen .
i therefor welcom mr gebhardt 's report .
i would like to have much more precis inform on this .
the review is therefor import .
there are still some challeng to be overcom , howev .
a of now , these campaign have yet to be organis .
i certain embrac that concept .
hope , that will chang with the new govern .
it ha been far too easi up to now .
if we are to have progress , this ha to be done .
we can not afford to wait .
of cours , these must not act a a gateway for social dump .
that is great .
one of our greatest achiev is that one can now move legal .
after one year , we are on the way to do this .
proper condit must be in place .
i hope the babi is well !
i wa also struck by what you said , mr rapti .
i myself am visit the member state , a wa note earlier .
mr harbour mention the perform test that we have begun .
mr presid , this debat wa veri interest and illumin .
plea do not fall into the trap of compar appl and orang .
we therefor realli need to veri close monitor what happen .
the debat is close .
written statement ( rule 149 )
now we are to do so a second time .
it is a pure procedur decis that is to be taken here .
that will take place at a later date .
that is someth that sure ha to chang .
i think it realli is enough now .
the commiss ha taken on this initi .
the council ha formal ask u for our assent .
i have one more point to close with .
we do not have mani resourc in europ .
maintain the status quo is not an option .
in the eu , it cost eur 20 000 for onli 13 member state .
( it ) i turn now to our italian friend .
mr presid , thank you for your patienc .
we made a propos .
there will be no discrimin .
there is noth new about it .
it is time to cut the gordian knot !
i do believ that we will make progress , howev .
we will not relinquish a singl right .
we need this now .
we have no time to lose .
we need to keep a sen of proport here .
i am oppos to enhanc european cooper .
the question is , under what condit ?
i think we should give more thought to this .
the commiss , howev , want to forg ahead with this .
so exact who is in favour of this ?
howev , we are not here today to resolv a linguist issu .
he refer to innov a our generat 's sputnik moment ' .
we all share these principl .
we support anyth that improv and expand the intern market .
spanish is spoken by 850 million peopl .
what criterion were use ?
are we talk about eur 1 850 ?
is it about time ?
is it to do with polit , a i suspect ?
this battl ha onli just begun .
nevertheless , there is someth new .
25 out of 27 state are particip .
the polit framework ha chang .
we must all now work to achiev better respect for all .
( e ) mr presid , let u not delud ourselv .
ladi and gentleman , let u remain calm .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
howev , i do have reserv about the languag to be use .
time is the onli resourc which is not renew .
the time we lose never come back .
we can not experi europ sole through auster programm .
that is the first thing that ha to happen .
this contin - the european union - need to be more invent .
we need to creat more invent and exploit them more .
i would just like to deal with a few import point .
this presid ha achiev a great deal in other area too .
the issu at stake here is a procedur decis .
mr lehn ha alreadi point this out .
in which case , whi can the patent itself not be innov ?
it is also a great challeng .
howev , i believ it will benefit all research in the eu .
i support the propos for enhanc cooper .
in other word , it will not have to pay ani damag .
there are three languag .
this is one of the area in which europ ha anoth advantag .
and what happen ?
mr roithová mention the word counterfeit ' just now .
i am refer , for exampl , to invent of medicin .
i sincer believ that no such risk exist .
in this case , we need unanim .
this wa not a simpl decis .
to achiev this , we must do everyth we can .
i would also like to react to two other remark .
we need the singl market and we need to strengthen it .
this is absolut self-evid .
howev , it should also pay for this itself .
the debat is close .
the vote will take place on tuesday , 15 februari 2011 .
written statement ( rule 149 )
i have a provoc question , howev .
i have no choic but to vote against .
half of these cost are associ with translat .
this eu-wid patent make sen !
noth ha been decid yet .
we have a new round of negoti befor u .
radioact contamin of foodstuff ( debat )
- c7-0137/2010 - .
these are , obvious , top prioriti for the european union .
the highest safeti standard are therefor call for .
we therefor need a number of adjust .
that wa in 1986 .
we are therefor propos to make explicit provis for this .
no explicit provis ha yet been made to that effect .
the second reason relat to substanc .
most of the other amend relat to this chang of legal basi .
this is econom absurd .
it is of much wider public concern .
we need clear guidelin that everyon can have confid in .
this is basic the central question .
we are all well awar of the import of this debat .
the problem of the maximum level remain , howev .
we have the case of urgeiriça in portug , for exampl .
it is import that we take all this into account .
this is the onli way we can enhanc our own secur .
i have not forgotten that .
therefor , these are issu that interest me , mr harm .
i wa also the french agricultur minist not so long ago .
i thank you for your attent and your commit .
the debat is close .
these instrument have met with great success .
in short , there is no need to ask brussel for them .
this is what ha been done a regard futur financi program .
europ need to becom more competit .
the second wa to reduc cost by cut red tape .
an excel exampl of this is the servic direct .
we will provid our support for this in parliament .
they provid mani more job than do the larger firm .
here , i agre with what mr herczog said .
this is import for both sector .
let u follow this exampl .
let u not forget this question in today 's debat .
we in the european union have adopt new legisl .
that is where it all start and then move down the chain .
second , these compani , smes , are concern about financ .
so the situat in my countri is chronic .
it is not good enough .
we have heard the mantra of bank be too big to fail .
that is unaccept .
it is the privat sector that creat the job .
on paper , we encount one sme initi after anoth .
howev , innov also requir money and research .
that is not enough , howev .
we shall continu with it and appli it strict .
the debat is close .
written statement ( rule 149 )

we are face with an incred opportun here .
there are ten countri along this river .
there will be follow-up confer , report , etc .
whi includ a list of prioriti ?
the next point is coordin .
this increas european public interest in the project .
this prior decis must be withdrawn at all cost .
this should also be reflect in parliament 's resolut .
turn now to the legal basi .
good for the east and good for the west !
by this i mean real ownership of the process .
implement should be regul through a commiss action plan .
is there an overlap ?
this is a fundament requir if europ is to develop .

cord blood stem cell ( debat )
similar , adult stem cell are also show promis potenti .
the eu ha no compet to harmonis the use of cell .
we can encourag it ; we can not dictat it .
we need clear standard for qualiti and safeti .
i think that this aspect is le import .
it is therefor import for u to have these bank .
do so is to pay unnecessarili .
that should be the open that we aim for .
the possibl are immens .
this fals promis that is be sold to parent cost money .
in this context , i believ that we need a strategi .
we agre that this need to be encourag .
the commiss encourag member state to take such action .
the debat is close .
written statement ( rule 149 )
this is hard surpris .
until recent , this blood wa regard a biolog wast .

some done , but a lot more to do .
it sound rather like a threat .
we are not to be push around by putin .
we stand by them .
our fight is their fight .
their object are our object .
the problem is turkey 's intransig and arbitrari polici .
for this , i would like your support and attent .

that is how it should be .
there is no altern to this cooper .
we need to act swift .

that conclud the item .
agenda of the next sit : see minut
closur of the sit
open of the sit
this is , of cours , not sustain .
mr presid , the first read should be the except .
we can be proud of what we have achiev .
( the presid interrupt the speaker )
it concern the propos for speed limit .
overal , we are therefor plea with the compromis .
we all send her our veri best wish .
she ha done an excel job on this dossier .
overal , we are all plea with the compromis .
what do i mean by that ?
we must keep a veri close eye on how the situat develop .
we must not forget that .
this mean that the air qualiti in our citi will improv .
we are take an import step forward today .
this wa a fundament requir for our group .
some comment have alreadi been made about the first read .
we did not need to introduc that into the second read .
i would like to thank everyon concern onc again .
this should depend on the dossier .
how are the discus go ?
how controversi are they ?
this is what we have done .
howev , i will not be express my thank for the agreement .
it will not do the competit of the car industri ani good .
the question is where are we go to sell car in 2020 ?
it will , of cours , be much higher than that .
i would like to end by thank all of the rapporteur .
in my opinion , that would have been feasibl .
this feebl compromis is a gift to the industri .
this report is unaccept .
my father 's small busi remain small .
this help busi , not hinder them .
it will put it up by at least eur 5 000 .
the first is how no one talk about global warm anymor .
if it wa not such a tragedi , it would be a farc .
there ha been no chang in that whatsoev .
they did not .
what an absolut nonsens this ha been .
they are virtual all in citi .
i think everyon will agre with what ha been said .
therefor , all this is realli a step in the right direct .
i am also glad to see that there are penalti .
i suspect it will not increas it by a singl euro .
the fact is that oil price are now at usd 100 a barrel .
we should be drive forward that ambit .
he know it will , and i know it will .
doe he think that is fair ?
doe he think it is moral correct ?
in do so , it want busi to pay more than they need .
the direct now need to be introduc a quick a possibl .
we must therefor be veri care .
instead , we simpli need to do what is possibl .
i welcom the compromis that ha been reach .
therefor , the cost of these vehicl must remain manag .
i hope that it will receiv broad support .
i would like to make two comment by way of conclus .
this also appli to the case of vehicl emiss .
( fr ) mr presid , commission , i will be brief .
much more ambiti .
it would also have translat into save for the consum .
in the end , they appreci that .
that wa also an answer to mr vlasák and his concern .
this is what we are tri to do .
i would not be surpris if the same thing happen with van .
so regul for car is in place .
now it is the turn of van .
i appreci the veri broad support for this piec of legisl .
i have to say that i simpli do not understand that remark .
mr wil compar this regul with the passeng car regul .
in my view , that is a fals comparison .
this will result in overal cost save for mani busi .
( applaus )
in conclus , i think this is a good result .
the debat is close .
written statement ( rule 149 )
right of passeng in bus and coach transport ( debat )
the final text can be deem a plea and balanc compromis .
togeth , they work tireless in help to move thing forward .
this legisl act will therefor be sign tomorrow .
let me congratul you on a job well done .
i think the scope of the report is correct .
we have said that three countri are not direct affect .
this can be dealt with at a region level .
but doe it move u forward ?
there are some posit aspect to all of this .
that , of cours , is not a good thing .
thank you .
they have achiev what is a genuin veri reason compromis .

3. compens and assist in case of an accid .
i also consid the improv inform for passeng to be posit ;
i believ the agreement is a good compromis .
this is a good decis , congratul !
howev , some point in the propos go too far .
we must avoid inappropri measur like this in futur .
our group will therefor abstain .
this is fine in principl .
have said that , this regul complet the list .
this should be enforc on the ground , in particular .
that is import , in my opinion .
for these reason , we want to support this compromis .
air travel is not the same a bus travel .
inde , it would put mani of them out of busi .
it is good in patch .
one size doe not fit all .
i live myself over 300 kilometr from our capit .
we will have to monitor this a we go forward .
the compromis wa preced by long consult .
the number of peopl with disabl will skyrocket overnight .
in the case of buse , it is two hour .

we must move forward quick and proper on this subject .
the first aspect is solidar .
solidar in the union also mean respons .
we must do more to respond to current challeng .
we must do more togeth , and we must not be divid .
i think i can say that we can count on your support here .
we must avoid this at all cost .

all of this make our work difficult .
i am delight to hear that you also share these reserv .

what will be the composit of the secretariat ?
will there be a role for the european parliament ?
ha that occur to him ?
can we reach a major in favour of a simplifi procedur ?
we shall see .
i have some good argument for this .
this problem can also be resolv through articl 136 .
i would like to make a third and final comment .
whi is that ?
it is becaus the intergovernment method is not work .
we are deal with an emerg situat .
we need more transpar in this area .
i would now like to see this be put into practic .
we must evalu what is be done .
i would like to say one more thing at this point .
the fund that we current have avail are not suffici .
a decis wa made in brussel today to provid more liquid .

the european parliament must provid an answer .
this is whi we need a strong europ .

i support the intent behind this treati chang .
like other , i am concern about the mechan .
how can that possibl be the case ?

my last remark is to mr higgin from ireland .
written statement ( rule 149 )
we have alreadi taken step to review them .
it is a subject that concern the peopl of europ .
we should be proud of all of this .
this make it clear that the enforc process is not work .
no one disput our sen of solidar .
european solidar is not be call into question .
it is need now more than it ever ha been .
now , with algeria , the pressur ha shift to itali .
our border are the european border .
howev , this is obvious not enough .
that is what parliament ha call for .
unfortun , this case is not at all uniqu .
it also demonstr the need for european solidar .
it is import that we avoid more case like this one .
of cours , that is not , ultim , ani solut , at all .
they had to pay the greatest financi claim .
they were neglig .
whi are you not say that ?
europ ha made a mess of it own asylum system .
inde , it is not an à la cart menu .
in ani case , she can count on my commit .
the netherland doe not want those asylum seeker .
otherwis , europ will end up becom eurabia .

nor do all the member state have the same procedur .
we are tire of talk about abus and traffick .
this is urgent , commission .
this is not fair .
we have no detent centr for asylum seeker .
we support you fulli in that regard .
peopl need to be treat in a decent way .
we need to ensur protect for the most vulner .
we need to improv that .
on greec , the commiss is do a lot to help .
there are long-stand problem .
of cours , greec ha the main respons .
it ha done a lot , but need to do more .
late , turkey ha shown itself to be construct and cooper .
of that number , 12 638 ( 77 % ) were accept .
the legisl act are on the tabl .
the debat is close .
we are readi to assist both itali and tunisia .
i know prepar at technic level are be made .
i invit all member state to show their support .
this is , of cours , also a prioriti .
i propos five step .
they should be sent back to tunisia where they came from .
it is time to say that no countri is alon .
it is an issu for the european institut .
the lesson of recent week ha realli not been learnt .
the infrastructur is in place .
all that is lack is the polit will and the sen of solidar .
( nl ) mr presid , we have a real emerg in europ .
the european border appear to be a leaki a a siev .
regard the mediterranean , today we have noth to say .
we shall appreci your good intent and stop there .
( it ) mr presid , thank you for the question .
( fr ) yes , it wa the last speaker but two .
what should i tell my constitu who are afraid ?
what can the commiss do , and what can frontex do ?
the first level concern the immedi situat .
the second level is more strict polit in natur .
talk doe not cost anyth , but we need to act .
i do not believ it is .
the problem we are discus is both technic and polit .
whoever come to malta will have no choic but to remain .
yet , malta can not extend ani further .
the eu ha learnt noth from it past experi .
it wa taken complet by surpris by the stream of refuge .
howev , that is exact the problem .
we can not do it all alon , howev .
we need to address this with the utmost urgenc .
abov all , we must respond quick .
could we check ?
it would not be so difficult .
five thousand .
that would also be a good trip to make .
we could help them through region develop .
the author are no longer abl to control the situat .
we need a rapid and joint respons .
we need a rapid respons now .
in addit , there is , of cours , the public relat problem .
we must rememb what these countri have realli achiev .
one thing is clear .
this is whi we need to deal with this problem now .
( el ) madam presid , the mediterranean is go up in flame .
obvious , immigr will increas .
europ today ha just 2.7 % of the muslim popul .
we have to act in solidar with itali and we can do so .
the council is not interest in this issu .
today , the problem is in lampedusa .
tomorrow , it will be in malta and crete .
we need solidar .
we are not there yet .
frontex is also involv in do analysi for the whole region .
ladi ashton wa there yesterday for discus with the author .
econom assist can be provid .
there is also discus about a donor confer .
i think mani were quit surpris when the berlin wall fell .
we did not have an action plan immedi up our sleev .
the debat is close .
written statement ( rule 149 )
the debat we are deal with today is particular import .
adequ , sustain and safe european pension system ( debat )
it wa not easi to manag such a larg number of amend .
member state are rais their retir age .
good supervis : yes !
you can not link deriv and pension fund , just like that .
in a pension fund , deriv are use to hedg risk .
henc , not for specul .
so even there , commiss , you must look befor you leap .
turn now to the third pillar .
it seem to me that we should not harbour unrealist expect .
final , i would like to make two conclud comment .
social discont can trigger unexpect effect .
i would like the rapporteur to comment on this .
the green paper offer a consult ...
the former restor stabil , while the latter endang it .
congratul , ria !
i think this is the start of that process .
but the core question is : who is respons ?
demograph chang and so do work practic .
pension system fall within the compet of the member state .
the compromis were achiev under serious time pressur .
i , person , am against that , but where doe it say that ?
in my opinion , this simpli will not work .
we should investig this issu in detail .
this is a good opportun for u to do the groundwork .
there , you have point to the import of solvenc ii .
so , there is a job that need do .
in futur , job in the social sector must be better paid .
peopl want proper , secur pension in their old age .
the public ha financ the rescu packag for the major bank .
young peopl will be start work later and later .
i would like to give mr andor a clear messag .
i think she ha done a veri good job .
but what we can do is share best practic and experi .
i am sorri that this wa not in the report .
the main conclus which we support are that :
it is essenti to rais the retir age ;
the eu should persuad member state to rais the retir age .
subsidiar ?
what subsidiar ?
econom , demograph and labour market tradit vari .
risk for pension are not the same a insur compani or bank .
this situat goe against the eu 2020 strategi .
where is the other sixty-odd percent ?
the bottom line is that they , too , should be work .
( applaus )
this is whi i want , if i may , to emphasis three point .
extend one 's work life must result in an improv pension .
this standard also need to look to the futur .
this is whi we need to take step in this area .
with the white paper , we are just wast time .
that is a general recognis fact .
the number of pension is increas .
this pose a threat to the sustain of the pension system .
nation budget can not secur a decent old age .
we alreadi have experi of this .
i do not know where mr de jong is .
there he is , at the back .
that is not true .
subsidiar is the guid principl here .
i hope that satisfi you , mr de jong .
the debat is close .
written statement ( rule 149 )
the demograph situat is not in our favour either .
therefor , the system 's sustain is an urgent problem .
it should pay to have child , rather than just be a cost .
whi wa this ?
we can not support the plan crime of the centuri !
woman more often have atyp employ contract than men .
let me give the exampl of my own countri .
falsifi medicin product ( debat )
falsifi medicin are about public health .
i would also like to thank all the shadow rapporteur .
the issu of internet sale remain unresolv .
the direct repres a step forward .
we should have move faster .
i would have like the propos to go further on this front .
we have had lengthi discus on this matter .
yet i do not think our work end there .
we will need to monitor care how this direct is implement .
someon we know is ill and in a desper situat .
we are grate to the commiss for produc this propos .
it is true that we have been discus it for some time .
yes , we could have gone further .
what have we achiev ?
howev , we are also not compromis on patient safeti .
what el have we achiev ?
we have implement an earli warn system .
this wa a huge task and she ha done veri well .
we have produc some veri good result .
i believ that we can be proud of what we have achiev .
we have produc a piec of legisl that bring real benefit .
could we have gone further ?
the answer is yes .
should we have gone further ?
here i must say no .
we have address the internet pharmaci issu .
we have look at the safeti featur .
a they say , rome wa not built in a day .
i look forward to build on the foundat of this direct .
that is whi this propos is so import .
it is import that we adopt clear definit .
this must not happen in such an import case a this .
the falsif of medicin is a grow problem .
these are onli those case that have come to light .
this is whi action wa urgent need .
we have taken a reason approach .
peopl 's health should not be trifl with .
i am veri plea that this scheme ha address that issu .
i suppos that is up to each individu member state .
we all know that the pharmaceut industri is veri big busi .
could we tri and find a happi medium , plea .
there is also one point on which we will need to be vigil .
initi , we had a veri heat discus on this subject .
this wa a warn which prompt u to speed up our work .
we have guarante the traceabl of medicin .
howev , i would like to make one request .
i am veri plea that parallel trade ha been retain .
i would like to make one final point .
i veri much support this regul .
a lot of work ha been done .
we will do everyth in our power to ensur proper traceabl .
inspect in third countri are import .
therefor , we have to be pragmat .
this is the polici we have to push forward .
thank you also for your support .
the debat is close .

today , albania is in polit crisi .
the tone in tirana need to chang .
the danger downward spiral must end .
the polit crisi must be resolv .
this is the share respons of the polit leader in albania .
the govern and opposit must do it togeth .
we can help to bridg the gap through our activ engag .
there is no place for cherry-pick .
rather , they bring clear , measur benefit for citizen .

it is not too late .
the european parliament also ha a vital role to play .
you a politician can send a clear messag to politician .
i believ that it ha been well receiv .
i welcom his decis .
new local elect will take place soon .
we support the action by mr lajčák .
none of them wa abl to come up with an answer .
the blame game seem more import .
they should be support by all polit parti .
democraci is not winner take all ' .
mr presid , the crisi in albania is noth new .
this crisi is a crisi of polit cultur .
so are corrupt , manipul of the medium and polit appoint .
the govern ha a particular respons .
the opposit also ha a respons .
how do you get both parti that far , though ?
unfortun , that did not bring about ani chang .
we would realli be harm the citizen if we did that .
democrat institut are weak and press freedom is scarc .
albania is , after all , a secular countri in practic .
unfortun , the impass persist .
unfortun , howev , thing have got wors .
i wish you a great deal of strength and success in this .
albania is await the local elect of may this year .
this will be anoth check on democraci in the countri .
he is use to address and resolv tricki problem .
i wish both of them the best of luck .
i admit that i wa sceptic when this debat start .
i hope that this remain the case .
i agre with mr belder .
this is what albania urgent need .
howev , we do not want albania to be isol .
we want it to start out on the road toward europ .
i agre with those who say that this need to be investig .
it is import to find out who is realli to blame .
that is what is need .
i hope that will not be the case .
the other possibl would be to freez the ipa fund .
reach a consensus is someth entir new in albania .
i believ that this is import .
what sort of govern open ballot box ?
not the sort that we have in my countri or in your .
how can negoti take place about this if it is not allow ?
now the situat ha escal and four peopl have been kill .
mr presid , i welcom the statement by the commission .
everyon bear their share of respons .
we must all be involv in this process .

yes , we fulli support the fight against corrupt .
the commission wa veri care .
whi is everyth not given to the judici author ?
whi is it filter by the ministri of the interior ?
we have alreadi seen leakag of the inform .
you cite data from 2008 and 2010 .
you state that onli one or two percent are use in court .
the commiss should look into that .
whi is there this scandal in bulgaria ?
we realli have to look into this matter .
( bg ) mr presid , just a quick question , mr swoboda .
second , the import thing is how it is use .
that is the major issu .
this may be polit motiv or it may be person motiv .
we should fight against this kind of misus .
ha that led to a lessen of the regard for right ?
i would ask the commiss to watch this space veri care .
the situat in bulgaria , howev , is particular strang .
while you were in power , kidnap were a daili occurr .
the mafia wa all-pow , while citizen had no right .
the court were bought and sold .
howev , it will not work , becaus the voter are not blind .
would they recognis themselv in this debat ?
i doubt it .
the offici figur are complet differ .
they are public avail to anyon who care about the truth .
howev , i would like to ask a question .
sinc when ha this inform been transpar ?
tomorrow , it may be anoth member state .
for that reason , the commiss must investig this .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
situat like this can onli lead to further social violenc .

there are other import issu .
the stockholm programm ha not been consign to the museum .
so what is it that ha provok the debat in this hous today ?
the answer is simpl .
i would like to make a littl joke here .
the veri opposit is true .
that is what the bulgarian elector vote for in 2009 .
howev , let u not be naïv .
this is an infring of a number of european direct .
it is an infring of the charter of fundament right .
today 's debat is about the truth .
the truth can not be right-w or left-w .
there can be no half-truth .
i want to respond to mr strasser .
show arrest have been carri out with deliber heavy-handed .
( de ) mr presid , i would like to speak to you direct .

this is not low carbon and this is not sustain .
the question though is this .
we have known about these problem for two decad now .
we have seen a slight chang in this strategi .
we should respond to growth in demand with suppli .
we just need to have courag .
i also believ that there is a lot of untap potenti .
at the begin , we need to lead by exampl .
all project financ by the world bank must have this aim .
i would like to make a number of comment .
i would like to congratul mr keller on her excel work .
it is a if they were assumpt unworthi of discus .
there are limit to arrog .
we must be more democrat .
the situat wa unaccept .
what ha happen to all the project ?
where are the solar plant in the tropic ?
where are the sustain forest in the amazon or in vietnam ?
where are the solar panel and wind turbin in kenya ?
there is absolut noth there .
the hypocrisi of this debat is total unbeliev .
they have simpli said we have had enough ! ' .
we should have spoken out much more loud .
the whole thing is embarrass .
this will play a central role in develop cooper .
i think a few point need to be made more precis .
the question is : do we financ them or do we not ?
it is a genuin opportun to respond to energi challeng .
now it seem that we are well on track .
the world bank make the whole process veri open .
there will be the world bank energi week in washington .
otherwis , mani peopl could attempt to evad this challeng .
it is definit a question of where to start .
most import , we should beef up .
we have energi facil : eur 200 million .
you can not do too much on energi with eur 200 million .
the debat is close .
the vote will take place on thursday , 17 februari 2011 .

plea allow me to add just one more sentenc .
thank you for your patienc , mr presid .
i agre with mr posselt that it is a fair report .
we can not give up on this object for the western balkan .
some of you have mention chapter 23 on corrupt .
the icti ha been mention .
this is veri serious .
our concern are not artifici .
medium freedom is also under assault .
former minist have been charg with corrupt .
now it is be hand out without a shot be fire .
croatia ha had to make extens and intrus legisl chang .
we should support this for polit reason .
the general polit messag is import .
more work ought to be done in this regard .
effect investig , prosecut and court rule are need .
there are two point i would like to stress here today .
the first is the reform and strengthen of the judiciari .
threat of violenc against minor are complet unaccept .
i hope that this is achiev a soon a possibl .
that is beyond disput and i am plea about that .
the protect of human right is a key issu for the eu .
second , there is the corrupt .
it still permeat societi , industri and polit .
that is my sincer wish .
croatia ha not complet these reform yet .
the process must continu .
the peopl of europ have misgiv .
we have a duti to make a success of this access .
this is also underlin in your report and resolut .
we all know that what we have here is unfinish busi .
the debat is close .
written statement ( rule 149 )
the report is general favour for croatia .
even the 2010 return of serbian refuge wa veri limit .
the question is what this step will be like .
we must be open to new member state .
thank you .
τhe next item is the joint debat on
the council and commiss statement on europ 2020 ;
inde , it is of particular import for all of u .
this is the europ 2020 strategi .
let me emphasis some import element concern econom govern .
this is the major challeng for europ in the year to come .
manag the european semest will be a real test for the eu .
howev , i want to be clear on this .
the commiss will present it propos by june .
we would simpli like to draw your attent to three point .
howev , it is here that import matter will be decid .
how do you envisag democrat debat on this issu ?
what do we mean by this govern ?
this mandat the involv of parliament .
what you are recommend to u is noth new .
i have not seen ani other recommend .
we want to get to know your econom model .
there is noth about ani of these thing in your document .
i would also like to address the member state direct .
we need financ of these project .
they all have the potenti to creat job and growth .
i applaud the huge major behind the joint resolut .
what exact is your recommend ?
to cut public expenditur !
you do not get stabl public financ by cut expenditur .
there is no talk of revenu .
howev , that is not all .
there are also measur for the financi sector .
we must strike soon and strike hard .
can you tell me what europ 2020 ha to do with all that ?
that is a lie , and in my view this debat is a farc .
now where are the job go to come from ?
have they promot the singl market ?
have they encourag enterpris ?
have they encourag onlin trade ?
they should get down to work !
it continu to count on the stabil and growth pact .
it mean extend work life , in other word pension cut .
in this regard , mani peopl talk about limit debt .
nobodi want that .
there remain one problem : support solar energi .
some 25 million peopl in the european union are unemploy .
industri polici need to have an infrastructur .
this can be translat direct into the europ 2020 strategi .
these attack must stop .
how el are we go to compet ?
we have to make sure that no one is left behind .
now is the time to start deliv on them .
there is inconsist here .
it is a fact that we have 23 million unemploy in europ .
we have 5.5 million unemploy below the age of 25 .
we have increas number of poor worker .
address them take money and need appropri .
howev , unfortun , fund is be cut back throughout europ .
what doe this mean ?
howev , we must tri .
job vacanc need specialis labour .
we must succeed .
word are not enough .
we need action .
what are we go to do ?
how are we go to financ the propos initi and action ?
to date this pictur doe not yet exist .
there are three import action to be taken .
we must focus on peopl .
you have given u a lot of fine word .
you are wrong .
there is no altern to that .
govern do not creat job and are not job creator .
the major problem in europ is the lack of competit .
i agre with that , in itself .
that is a veri bad idea .
it will be a job killer .
what are we actual do to promot growth and stabil ?
that is rather dishonest .
or have we obstruct it ?
where and when will they find work ?
where and when ?
i expect a concret answer .
mr morvai , that wa not the spirit of your question .
this is what i wa specif refer to .
thus , we need to be more care in our consider .
we realli must exercis restraint in this regard .
i am talk here about energi , transport and communic .
this includ a clear basi for our own resourc .
howev , the question of money is crucial here , too .
some previous speaker have alreadi talk about this .
the impact on the peopl local will be disastr .
sustain job can onli be creat if europ stick togeth .
a divid europ will not be a competit europ .
we are in agreement with this and we support this .
problem might veri well aris .
i agre on the issu of pension and wage .
this is the case at the moment .
how are we to understand this ?
it ha not been an easi time for europ .
first , we realli need europ a a whole .
we need the region of europ .
we can larg respond to this need through cohes polici .
peopl and worker must be respect .
i would like to know what the point of that is .
that is not the right way to go .
we are wait for the treati of lisbon to be appli in full .
the inconveni truth is that europ is experienc a recoveri .
we are experienc a veri fragil and divid recoveri .
this lesson ha to be learn .
this must begin by stabilis the euro .
unemploy remain lower in these countri .
we are pursu a robust agenda for financi regul .
commission barnier 's work should not be underestim .
we have launch the microfin facil .
in this case i must mention in particular young peopl .
youth unemploy is veri dramat in some member state .
again we have to be awar of diver .
but youth is not the onli problem group .
the employ guidelin are to be renew .
parliament will be involv in the discus in various way .
none of them must be damag in this exercis .
this is the first time , it is the first exercis .
just to mention two thing briefli .
i would just like to underlin one thing .
the council want to fulli respect the communiti method .
we have no reserv whatsoev in this regard .
there were major shift in compet .
we all know about them .
we will strict abid by that .
of cours , we alway have to be in line with the treati .
now my last remark is veri short .
it is about the money .
i could not agre more .
there will be a long debat .
( fr ) you should not put the cart befor the hors .
the debat is close .
( fr ) we have taken note of your point .
thank you veri much .
written statement ( rule 149 )
there is noth to show that this will automat be the case .
the europ 2020 strategi is reveal it true agenda .
the last european council confirm it .
where are we now ?
is the europ 2020 strategi also doom to failur ?
there is good reason to believ so .
this previous way is no longer feasibl .
this situat is reflect on the labour market of latgal .
the next item is the vote .
( for the result of the vote : see minut )
falsifi medicin product (
adequ , sustain and safe european pension system (
2010 progress report on croatia (
explan of vote
oral explan of vote
i welcom the commiss 's propos .
that percentag is constant rise .
this is about peopl 's health .
they may also be a risk to health .
counterfeit is a crime and must carri specif penalti .
the victim are consum .
we could nevertheless have hope for a more ambiti outcom .
i therefor hope that improv can be made in the futur .
this is a major impedi to job creation and inde growth .
( nl ) mr presid , i would just like to make a suggest .
european pension system are in an increas alarm state .
in europ , woman still earn on averag 18 % le than men .
this would , howev , be desir .
i would hope for flexibl in this .
in this we perhap need europeanwid coordin .
the 2020 strategi present a dream futur to u .
they use the word woman ' onli six time .
we are in fact face serious demograph challeng .
debat on rais the retir age are be held in mani countri .
a i said , life expect is increas .
pension system fall under the compet of the member state .
mr presid , i welcom this report .
there is no sen whatev in that .
we see here their sheer hunger for power .
rude and incontin .
we are talk about the harmonis of public sector salari .
i am sure you can spot the logic flaw here .
we must make sure we have a consist messag .
this unfair can not , of cours , be refinanc via the eu .
we need european coordin in this regard .
that is inde the case .
this report repres a step in this direct .
today that is difficult and there are flaw in the system .
i vote for it a well .
we should actual be learn from our past mistak .
i vote for this report and i congratul the rapporteur .
the countri farthest along in it effort is croatia .
of cours , no countri is without it fault .
i think there are real loss potenti to croatia .
our parliamentarian are not the owner of our freedom .
it lack the basic infrastructur of a free societi .
the croatian medium are subject to censorship and intimid .
written explan of vote
falsifi medicin are a global danger .
this is the reason whi i vote for this report .
this pose a major threat to the health of eu citizen .
the european parliament wa right to take thing in hand .
health is the most import asset in everyon 's life .
we should elimin ani risk .
this focus should not be troubl by other addit object .
howev , the eu must not allow this situat to be reach .
i vote in favour of the matia report becaus :
it is easi to make a larg profit .
this is a public health crisi on a global scale .
this is an import and necessari measur .
we vote for the matia report on falsifi medicin .
is there a desir to erad the natur medicin sector ?
who or what will benefit from this ?
not necessarili the health of the peopl of europ .
the guid principl should be patient welfar in all case .
more and more innov and life-sav drug are counterfeit .
thank you .
they are now be found increas in the eu .
around 1 % of medicin sold in europ are estim counterfeit .
this will allow for their traceabl .
their health is therefor at risk .
this , howev , is necessari .
i am therefor vote for this report .
that is whi i vote a i did .
in write . - i complet support the report of marisa matia .
this object must be reflect in the direct 's legal basi .
to conclud , this is an import piec of legisl .
what is a falsifi medicin product ?
what is an activ ingredi or an excipi ?
the commiss propos doe not provid the requir clariti .
clearer definit will result in simpler implement .
patient safeti ha to be the prioriti when deal with medic .
increas protect is provid for consum .
the cost for the industri are manag .
falsifi medicin are silent killer .
i would point out the central role of smes in all of this .
howev , onli 2 % of them have access to eu fund .
this is onli possibl with sustain smes .
for the abov reason , i vote for this resolut .
smes creat more than 70 % of job for lithuanian .
we must tri harder to remov administr obstacl .
i welcom the result of today 's vote .
entrepreneur benefit le from preferenti loan .
this make them feel like second-class citizen .
this ha highlight the fragil of certain financ scheme .
i vote in favour of this time report .
the percentag of peopl who are retir is rise .
the aspect of subsidiar requir further elabor .
therefor the eu ha a coordin role to play .
for these reason i abstain from the final vote .
i am awar of the dispar between pension system in europ .
this will ensur adequ protect of the dutch pillar system .
what is now need is a seri of polici coordin at eu level .
a potenti market of hundr of billion of euro .
i abstain dure the vote on this text .
nevertheless , other point have led me to abstain .
consider improv are still need in this regard .
we borrow in order to pay today 's pension .
this must chang .
ani other solut would mean live beyond our mean .
the denial of realiti is an act of gross neglig .
it ha a duti to explor coher and courag cours of action .
the necessari referendum is , unfortun , a long way off .
i am vote against , and absolut condemn , this text .
it is necessari to analys all 27 pension system in the eu .
this can have veri sad consequ .
therefor , i have vote against this report .
for all these reason , i vote in favour .
activ support is requir for job creation .
european pension system are in an increas alarm state .
in europ , woman still earn on averag 18 % le than men .
howev , i can not , on balanc , support it .
this impli a healthi and balanc nation budget .
life for pension in my countri is not the easiest .
the time ha come to stop appli doubl standard .
sudden they declar that the crisi is not yet over .
i am against ani regul of pension at a european level .
they are almost incompar .
legisl intervent is desir in this area .
i am confid that this deadlin will be met .
the peopl of croatia have great expect of this membership .
we must not repeat previous mistak .
we have therefor abstain from vote today .
what can be done to counter this percept ?
i vote for the motion for a resolut .
croatia clear ha a place in the european union .
i vote against the treati of maastricht .
i vote against the european constitut .
we must applaud the enorm progress alreadi made .
this ha also been describ in detail in the resolut .
in sever paragraph it is absolut intoler .
howev , the report is , by and larg , accept .
i therefor vote in favour of this motion for a resolut .
i hope this will happen soon .
follow these benchmark , i vote for this resolut .
i abstain from this vote .
eu membership will in ani case be subject to a referendum .
the vast major of case remain stuck at the investig stage .
i want to see zagreb take action .
we must learn from our experi with bulgaria and romania .
for this reason , we vote in favour of this resolut .
corrupt and judici reform have not been proper address .
we alreadi suffer from exampl of this elsewher .
correct to vote and vote intent : see minut

rise food price ( debat )
this is a press issu .
so what can the european union do to address this problem ?
this is high relev with regard to global food secur .
let me now come back to the issu of financi specul .
i am sure we can count on your support in all our effort .
thank you veri much for your attent .
howev , there is a lesson to be drawn from all this .
this is a major challeng for the commiss a a whole .
i am think in particular of livestock breed .
let me turn , final , to the role of trade .
i think we should rememb this .
( applaus )
i would first like to make the follow observ .
with new emerg economi consumpt level are increas .
this lead me to draw two major conclus .
( applaus )
i veri much welcom that .
too much food wa thought to be the problem .
that model can not meet the challeng we face in the futur .
we need to act now and build a new agricultur model .
we are onli at 3 % of the 2008 level .
the impact is also dramat for european farmer .
they are no longer abl to feed their anim .
hundr of farm have gone bankrupt .
this is a whole new ball game .
the commiss is demand that farmer adapt to market signal .
it would do well , today , to follow it own advic .
we have seen that in recent day .
i would just like to take u back a littl bit .
i have been a member of this parliament sinc 1989 .
hope we can find a way to do that .
so far onli usd 925 million ha been paid .
either way , retail food price can onli go higher .
what is the eu do about this ?
what would we be pay for food in that financi climat ?
i believ that , with regard to specul , moder is requir .
there is a real risk of a global food crisi .
the sign are worri .
so , food secur is our prioriti .
i do not believ that free trade is the answer .
consequ , we are inde talk about specul .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
how is this possibl ?
where doe the money go ?
it also offer detail answer and solut .
point ( d ) draw attent to the phenomenon of specul .
we therefor partial have the solut .
this underlin the dread consequ for those suffer countri .
we have to learn how to do that .
we must ensur a quick transit to stabil in north africa .
today , parliament is deliv a clear messag .
it is up to the commiss and the council to translat it .
the european union wa self-suffici in food until recent .
now it is import food .
there is an answer to all this .
peopl said that india would starv .
india did not starv .
brazil is now self-suffici in food .
we can do it if we have the will .
on the contrari , they repres the solut to the problem .
this will have two import consequ on european govern .
neither rout would be wise .
we need to invest in the common agricultur polici .
the commiss must propos measur ...
( the presid cut off the speaker )
the most import exchang are locat outsid europ .
there is no defenc for this obscen .
whi is the food market in the situat it is in ?
what can we say to them today ?
let u rememb 2008 and the situat the food market wa in .
did we learn from this ?
my answer is that we did not .
we are still limit product .
this chamber ha heard other comment concern agricultur .
mayb our colleagu should come here today and listen .
mayb they would learn someth about food secur .
we have a chanc to rectifi our mistak .
we talk about stabil .
where are these reserv to come from ?
who will pay for them ?
the problem of food secur is becom a global problem .
it is good that ...
( the presid cut off the speaker )
the articl wa about the fight for bread .
we must now give polit attent to this whole situat .
we must consid how we can produc food and make it avail .
we need to make the land that we have product .
for year we have complain that food price are too low .
there is , therefor , great caus for concern .
what wa the result ?
this should be a lesson for all of u .
it is not the way forward .
onli then will we have sensibl price .
they are wait , howev .
perhap here too we need concert action .
i have taken note of this issu .
nor is it the intent of the commiss to set land asid .
the debat is close .
the vote will take place on thursday , 17 februari 2011 .
written statement ( rule 149 )
current 30 % of the food produc in the world is wast .
this is unaccept , immor wastag and must be curb .
all this is caus chao on the market .
their despair creat a sourc of increas polit tension .
we can not observ these event passiv .
we must be readi to face a potenti crisi .
the cap reform must help in this direct .
specul on food price should furthermor be restrict .
barnier ha the right idea .
poverti is an issu within european border , too .
therefor we can not leav everyday foodstuff to self-regul .
situat in egypt ( debat )
there are alreadi report on the first step taken .
there is , howev , an import differ .
howev , let me be clear .
it is not for u to dictat outcom or impos solut .
the futur lie firm in the hand of the peopl of egypt .
the most import thing is : to consolid democraci .
this could also be extend to the entir eu .
howev , the eu 's appeal remain intact .
her action must be support by all of u .
third , commission , this is not the end .
for it is all rather extraordinari .
today everyon say that mr mubarak wa a dictat .
he wa not a dictat then .
what did we do when a tsunami claim score of victim ?
we mobilis except fund precis to help the peopl affect .
we can not delay .
i have one last point .
i do not think that this is the right solut .
i do not think that this is the right signal to send out .
( applaus )
mr presid , this debat is about how we help egypt .
that is a debat for anoth time .
the revolut in tunisia and egypt have someth in common .
howev , our neighbourhood polici ha been lack in credibl .
claus 2 ha never been implement .
this is what need to be chang , mr füle .
do you think that is in good tast ?
real stabil will onli come about if we support freedom .
i hope that we are on the right track here .
they will therefor have to be evalu .
that is jargon and hard anyon understand what it mean .
what doe it mean ?
but what el doe it mean ?
i call on our member not to be naïv today .
the egyptian are face an import choic .
islam and democraci do not mix .
imam should not be allow to control polit .
that is the question we must answer today .
the messag of egypt is a messag for the whole arab world .
this messag is not onli for the arab world .
the peopl can do it !
in other word , this is extrem import .
this is precis the role of the european parliament .
i hope that the european union will play it part in that .
we hope that this will be a transit to democraci .
it will be difficult .
he is absolut right .
they play a fundament role .
he said , of cours i am .
thing are go in the right direct . '
but there are problem .
we need much more time .
we are talk about egypt , but this process is spread .
we need to reward reform .
i still am .
i therefor welcom baro ashton 's visit to cairo next week .
propos have been made .
that is the messag that we are be sent .
noth ha end .
it is all just start .
new challeng and new prospect .
the question is what is europ do ?
what can it do and what must it do ?
certain not what is ha be do to date .
it ha basic been absent , with no cohes and no reflex .
will we succeed or will we fail ?
time is run out .
lampedusa is call u .
what can europ do , a the previous speaker said ?
this is possibl more import than fund and other matter .
these will be import in futur stage .
i would appreci your view .
( sk ) thank you veri much for the question .
we should reli on our own histor experi .
commission , can you do this ?
where wa our joy ?
everi other word from u wa simpli about maintain stabil ' .
we german in particular know what we are talk about .
what we had in egypt wa not stabil ; it wa oppress .
freedom and stabil can go hand in hand ani time .
we must recognis the choic that is made .
they were crush .
one young student wa kill .
whi do we never say anyth to encourag them ?
the first solut we propos is money .
they had money and a few shrewd peopl sock it away .
this hous ha an import role to play to play in that .
the debat is close .
written statement ( rule 149 )
this is veri good news .
the democrat transit is therefor under way .

commission , of cours we welcom it .
first of all , i have to ask you about the time .
plea let u know those concess have been secur .
we need answer on where we go on this crucial issu .
therefor sever amend are envisag .
we can not all be polit motiv .
whi ha the commiss not object to this lack of independ ?
you must be deepli unhappi about that .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
mr presid , freedom of speech is of great valu .
just look at poland 's experi .
( pl ) thank you for your question .
we are concern with protect the freedom of the medium .
what exact wa the point of this debat ?
there is no question about that .
onc it ha been complet , we should respect it .
that can not be right .
this is the reason that bring u here today .
so the question is , will this author be review ?
howev , that is someth that remain to be seen .
that is , i think , a touch pathet .
of cours , i hope that the commission will inde do that .
mr orbán wa not involv in this at the begin .
that is not compat with the legisl at eu level .
there is still no sourc protect .
therefor , this realli is not a democrat medium law .
mr kroe , you did not go far enough in my view .
we have not yet manag to provid this .
it is not a pleasant feel .
what doe commission neeli kroe think about this ?
there will be no more blue card question in this debat .
we do not have the time .
( interject from mr morvai : shame on you ! ' )
what a life !
to quot a hungarian socialist classic : fiddlestick ! '
this is not at all the case here , my fellow member .
in my opinion , we definit need to put a stop to that .
i will be brief , commission .
i give them on the basi of who rais their blue card first .
i wish there wa the time .
they do not oper in a legal vacuum .
that is a major success .
it is mislead .
consequ i am plea this even , but i am vigil .
you are the heir of sándor márai .
you are the heir of imr kertész .
so do not let u down !
dear furious fellow member , you have been deliber misl .
i do not know whether this law wa pas with good intent .
is what ha happen today a coincid ?
we have a combin of factor .
you have invit me to discus it befor .
second , we are talk about a veri import issu .
the third issu is , of cours , the hungarian presid .
let u not be naiv .
so do not underestim your own role .
what about the independ of the medium regul ?
( applaus )
so there is no doubt about that .
so that will be the text after the chang .
that should be one of the main prioriti .
the hungarian minist 's bodi languag is also say yes .
that will be done a soon a possibl .
now that is exact what happen .
a i said alreadi befor , the law would have been adopt .
now i believ that we are hope over that .

innov financ at a global and european level ( debat )
are we go to hide behind the lack of global agreement ?

a propos for revis of the etd is plan for spring 2011 .
you have not done this .
that will be the result of agre with mr gauzè .
thank you for your support .
this , of cours , provid the basi for europ 's growth .
mr presid , whi are we discus innov financ ?
have we gone tax mad all of a sudden ?
of cours not !
individu effort by member state are no longer effect .
what do you expect ?
it is too complex .
that is what is be refer to a a competit pact .
i would like to add someth on eurobond .
there is an increas moral risk here .
these instrument are urgent need .
some might criticis this a a transfer union .
i am sorri , but we are live in a global economi .
to do this would be to pursu kamikaz econom .
( de ) mr presid , you are wrong , mr farag .
from me , it is a clear yes ' to a financi transact tax .
yes - we need the european union precis for such matter .
the european parliament can prove itself here , too .
a tax rate of 0.03 % or 0.05 % is not suffici .
we should set ourselv a target of at least or up to 0.5 % .
i will certain be vote in favour of amend 2 tomorrow .
it is our duti a european .
not onli the socialist are say this .
my answer to this is yes ' .
second , do we need a tax on financi transact ?
in my opinion , it is an extrem interest avenu to explor .
i would like to know what is meant by global ' .
i think that that would be complet unreason .
she ha not had an easi job in recent week .
there is no technic reason not to do so .
it seem it prefer would be for a financi transact tax .
that is someth that i reject .
there are a seri of question that i would ask here .
to be complet honest , i do not know of ani .
it seem clear to me that that is the case .
the whole situat is veri complex .
in this context , we can also discus how innov we are be .
someon here ask what that would mean .
in the uk , a group ha been form to support the ftt .
no bank will pay for this .
so , the tax will be direct at custom .
that might be good becaus , of cours , we need tax .
but is it a good tax ?
i believ we should follow the epp line on this issu .
we support further studi .
i am disappoint that you have alreadi taken that decis .
this should be taken serious in the eu .
my answer to that is : so what if there is ?
it must lead the way in reform our financi system .
one particular posit idea is that of eurobond .
what we need to know is what the outcom will be .
this is a prerequisit .
let u not underestim the problem here .
if we listen to mr podimata , thing are actual quit simpl .
we take the money where we find it , and that is that .
today , bank are easi scapegoat .
they have sin and they must pay .
we must therefor be extrem cautious .
with regard to eurobond , there are three categori .
we do inde requir eurobond for that .
third and final , yes , we need these eurobond for invest .
across the globe , contin are invest .
therefor , we need these eurobond , these project bond .
i would mere like to add one comment .
i would like to add anoth comment .
the report ha , in fact , turn out rather well .
in poland , we did not supplement the financi system .
it seem that this system did not generat debt .
just one more comment on eurobond .
this is a good idea .
this report contain both help and also problemat initi .
they would entail a moral hazard ' , a they say .
it is a subject that concern the whole of parliament .
there are lesson to be learn .
the cure it suggest includ a financi transact tax .
do not buy time , commission .
do someth straight away .
first , becaus it is necessari and use .
it is essenti .
i wa plea to co-sign amend 3 , call for a feasibl studi .
in other word , it is a step in the right direct .
the figur that are circul might appear attract .
this wa veri clear illustr by mr schmidt and mr hökmark .
we also have to analys tax incid .
some of you rais the question of who will pay the tax .
there is no obvious answer here .
we have commit ourselv to do this by the summer break .
first issu : a global or a european tax ?
second issu : impact studi .
we must make sure that we do not get overtaken by event .

i should like to repli to mr hohlmeier 's comment .
madam presid , thank you mr fernand for this excel report .
we need to distinguish between greed and need .
it must make sen and must be reason in term of the futur .
one particular point of concern to my group is secur .

doe the eu want to rewrit histori ?
cost-effici is essenti .

we will includ croatia 's access in an amend budget .
we need to look close at this .
thank you , madam presid .
we must strive for maximum budgetari disciplin and auster .
what we are do at present is actual spend even more .
the voter ' question and comment are absolut spot-on .

no one ha even been caught .
the secur is littl more than a joke .
we should acquir an electron signatur .
the european union budget must promot increas employ .
thank you .
in such case , these fund should not be use up in full .
everyon el should return this money to the taxpay .
that figur today is bare 1.12 % .
i am well awar that we have new power .
the debat is close .
written statement ( rule 149 )
so whom do we owe it to ?
onli 3 % of board member of public list compani are woman .
that is not accept .
time to step on the gas .
these are the fact .
this is how thing stand at present .
what can we do ?
seventh , we should not ignor violenc against woman .
i think that we can do it .
we have the power .
parliament 's report show veri clear what the gap are .
the second element is woman in the world of employ .
onli from 5 march on did we start to be paid .
( applaus )
provid the fund to meet those challeng is also crucial .
it pay special attent to woman and young peopl .
let u do our utmost to make sure it achiev it aim .
there is an urgent need for action here .
this is one task we should all adopt for ourselv .
there are mani reason whi poverti is a femal issu .
i can onli go into some of them becaus of a lack of time .
let u start with the employ sector and the gender pay gap .
such a period is upon u again .
employ need to attract and retain woman .
in this spirit , we have support some of the amend propos .
i think we should also rememb these woman today .
quota are call for .
i can compar the use of quota with antibiot .
you talk about matern leav .
so you have done them no favour .
and now you are talk about quota .
what kind of mad is this ?
parent insur is good for equal on the labour market .
woman can also contribut to prosper in the eu .
( applaus )
speak to ani small businessman you like in my countri .
it is have 52 week of poor paid matern leav .
onli there are a lot of peopl who keep quiet .
( applaus )
poverti is a femal issu .
that is whi we need quota .
it is a shame that mr bloom ha alreadi left .
is it just the merit of woman that is be question ?
is it the case that men do not have merit ?
there ha been no action sinc then .
we have no more time for meaningless press releas .
we do not want to hear nice word from you .
we want equal pay now .
i do not think that this is the case .
we need a quota .
i hear that you want the second object i mention .
in some countri , societi is even take backward step .
fine word and declar of good intent are not enough .
we are worth the same and deserv the same .
they are the one without a voic .
i do not have the time to explain them all here .
you may ask whi .
this is warp , but veri interest .
this is an insult to woman .
that is not necessari .
( applaus )
our first task is to rais awar among woman .
we need a clear futur for our child .
thank you veri much .
without this , there will be no europ 2020 .
that must not be the kind of societi in which we live .
a you know , i am french and i wa against quota .

in posit of respons .
i think that we realli do need to go down this road now .
i feel we now need to resort to that approach , howev .

thank you .
it is wrong that men are becom richer and woman poorer .
my congratul .
( applaus )
this appli even when the man is on parent leav .
they prefer to opt for part-tim employ .
we should not forget that either .
if we are to move forward , we need three basic thing :
thank you for that .
male network oper without ani difficulti .
that is whi we need quota and wage equal .
i shall say no more , it ha all been said .
the trotskyist grew older , if not up .
in some case , they move into posit of power and influenc .
their idea spread much faster and further than they did .
in mani case , there is no identifi perpetr .
the discrimin is the rest of societi .
we are all guilti .
( applaus )
let u work togeth to bring about that chang .
unfortun , we do not do reason well in the economi .
we have no choic .
i have taken note of the intervent about the victim .
it is true that not all victim are femal or child .
( applaus )
mani concret action are possibl .
howev , direct job creation is also import .
i agre with mr zimmer .
this is also a question of regul work time .
that is absolut fundament .
a better work-lif balanc is absolut essenti .
this is part of our decent work agenda .
there are mani aspect to this question .
that is whi we have to act on mani front .
it fall to u all to show that these object are achiev .
strong polit will need to be back up by concret action .
we need to make sure that they are implement by everyon .
next , i would like to say that i strong support quota .
we have to make this gender equal becom a realiti .
and onc again , i wish all woman happi day .
the joint debat is close .
written statement ( rule 149 )
this report is an import step toward this .
it is this factor which lead to the pension gap .
howev , there are paradox figur worthi of consider .
onli 19 % of univers professor in the eu are woman .
equal is not an isol valu , either .
the need of woman are perceiv a second-level issu .
this is no small matter .
howev , the world still owe a debt to woman .
contracept must also be made readili avail to them .
make no mistak .
woman are fundament at risk through these measur .
the fight against inequ is not virtual realiti .
it concern real peopl .
( the sit wa suspend for a few moment )

this is a particular honour and privileg for me .
i am resum the sit .

this is true .
this is the main challeng face u .
thank you veri much .
our focus and our respons must be in line with this .
poverti and the european union .
some time ago , this would have seem an unlik associ .
the econom crisi hit the le protect group particular hard .
borrow the word of saint franci of assisi : ladi poverti .
the employ of woman strengthen woman 's digniti .
last , ladi and gentleman , plea allow me a brief digress .
this is intoler and ha to chang .
behaviour and attitud must also chang .
mr presid , one is not born a woman , one becom one ' .
it is woman who shoulder the main respons for the child .
we are see the feminis of poverti .
( applaus )
we must also have woman in the bank .
that is not democraci .
we need to use the whole of our talent base .

there are hard ani woman right at the top in manag posit .
( applaus )
the quota is the instrument wherebi we can achiev this .

it is quit clear that that system ha fail .
for onc , the metaphor is entir apposit .
it is a tax on trade rather than on profit .
the econom cost of the crisi are still to be fulli ass .
i believ we should do the same for the financi system .
this is exact what we saw .
it is time we learn the lesson of the financi crisi .
educ is the key in all member state .
in essenc , this is a matter for the member state .
i vote against this report despit it mani good idea .

the eu did not listen then and it ha not listen sinc .
infer from what ha happen .
the common agricultur polici ha exist sinc 1960 .
this is what the eu ha been do for longest .
the european union should be secur in it own food secur .
food is someth that we can not play with .
( de ) mr presid , i vote in favour of the häusl report .
protein is essenti for healthi anim nutrit .

despit measur , inequ persist .
woman are well educ .
the imag of european polit remain male .
we have a veri long way to go .

there is also discrimin in the labour market .
the same phenomenon can be seen in manag role .
take , first , the expens .
this will cost an extra billion pound .
premium will rise and fewer peopl will take up insur .
third , take the bad faith .
take , fifth , the attack on free contract .
mr presid , a court with a mission is a menac .

prepar of the eurozon summit of 11 march 2011 ( debat )
we are awar of the challeng that await u .
the road to democrat transit is never an easi one .
it can sometim be wind and it is alway demand .
the crisi ha shown just how interdepend our economi are .
it ha shown up certain structur weak .
this is a question of mutual confid and credibl .
competit is inde an essenti element for our economi .
it is a necessari condit for entrench job-creat growth .
my bottom line is growth and employ .
that is what this parliament and the commiss want .
the commiss will spare no effort to that end .
i thank you for your attent .
i know exact how far we have come .
i have wit this at compani level .
they do not necessarili need to be ident - just compar .
at the moment , this is far from be the case .
howev , that will probabl not alway be the case .
now is the time to work on creat job for the futur .
now is the time to tell thing a they are .
let u not miss this opportun !
this is great .
howev , the situat is kafkaesqu to put it mild .
this is no way to rescu the euro .
are you in agreement with this , mr rehn ?
what did germani do in it hour of deepest crisi ?
i do not know .
the countri is rank even lower than vietnam .
howev , peopl listen to what moodi 's ha to say .
do you know what moodi 's say ?
so what we are talk about here is a hair cut ' .
where will this eventu end ?
in the safeti net , of cours .
that is whi the pact itself make perfect sen .
howev , an imbal exist there .
what doe the word pact ' mean ?
a pact is an agreement between state .
an agreement between state is not what we need .
second , there is the approach .
there is no need for anyth at intergovernment level .
intergovernment ha never work within the european union .
the lisbon strategi wa intergovernment and it fail .
we must use the communiti approach .
howev , the pension system is much more complex than that .
that is what we must do a quick a possibl .
my request is a veri simpl one .
this must be done now .
( fr ) that is not how it is go to work .
the countri must also be in a posit to make invest .
this is realli what the crisi is increas about .
this would mean sustain growth .
mr barroso , you must stop mr oetting .
these are now core suggest under the competit pact .
this will certain be necessari .
whi is this ?
becaus their reason for present it are not veri clear .
the fact that it ha no valid is quit a differ issu .
they are both clever strategist .
i believ that they mean thing precis a state there .
this is the point i would like to return to onc again .
i believ that this is a veri serious issu .
it will be extrem hard to reduc debt .
i expect transpar in this matter .
it can not be done without inform !
that is not democraci !
he is say that we want an econom union .
nobodi ha vote for that .
nobodi ha been ask whether they want it .
what should be discus at the summit on friday is portug .
portugues bond yield hit 7.6 % on monday .
mr barroso know that himself .
we can not go on a a european union buy our own debt .
you constant refer to belgium a a non-exist nation .
do you know on what basi the belgian state wa found ?
madam presid , i am plea that mr schulz ha ask me that .
( de ) madam presid , i will onli be 30 second .
could i ask him what is the basi of the unit kingdom ?
is this not a union of nation ?
a veri proud one , i might add ?
madam presid , that is a good question .
we have made mani over the year .
you are quit right .
you are right .
it is veri difficult to hold togeth differ cultur .
that is onli to be applaud , of cours .
that should not go unment .
a such , europ urgent need to finish what it start .
in order to surviv , europ ha to chang cours now .
i should just like to use three word .
it wa govern that decid this in the treati of lisbon .
the second word is democraci ' .
the third word is effect ' .
that is the lisbon strategi !
that is the 10 year that have led u nowher .
we will get on with our work .
i would like to rais one veri specif point .
howev , what do the market seek ?
that is the realiti .
i want to conclud on this point if i might .
it is an import point .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
the competit pact and it evolut is a case in point .
that is whi you need the mechan , like all the eurozon .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
we can not just look at one side of the argument .
what they demand of u is sensibl and quick decis .
what is the treati basi for this exclus ?
whi exclud the will and abl ?
how doe the commiss view parliament 's propos ?
( the presid cut off the speaker )
i want to pose a question to the presid .
that is the hope that we will have the necessari chang .
howev , ladi and gentleman , let u have no illus .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
if there is a crisi , the rescu packag will be made avail .
therefor , if a countri is abl , it should be avoid .
that is the onli way to have the market ' trust .
consequ , it is not up to me to speak on their behalf .
we have push to the limit our govern ' ambit .
therefor , what we are say doe matter .
the hope that we are creat do matter .
therefor , i wa extrem frank and extrem open .
this therefor give u an opportun .
that is what is at stake .
the debat is close .
written statement ( rule 149 )
2010 progress report on turkey ( debat )
in order to achiev this , both parti must remain commit .
let me highlight some of these area .
these are all issu that need to be resolv urgent .
the eu-turkey relationship is strong .
at the same time , access negoti have slow down .
obvious , the cyprus issu weigh on the negoti .
let me turn now to the reform in turkey .
get the law right is import .
let me turn to the issu of migrat .
relat with turkey have also to be seen in a wider context .
mani of these challeng ahead are outlin in your report .
there are six prioriti , it seem to me .
third , minor right .
howev , dialogu alon is not enough .
fourth , woman 's right .
i have visit woman 's shelter .
i have spoken to turkish woman 's organis .
that ha to chang .
law are all veri fine , but enforc is also import .
thing have to chang in that respect in the come elect .
fifth , the ankara protocol is vital , in my opinion .
here , the respons lie with turkey .
sixth , foreign polici .
by the way , these are not just my prioriti .
briefli , just two more area of concern .
the commission ha spoken about this .
we must show respect for one anoth .
all of this is veri good .
it is extrem difficult to open new chapter .
what will happen when the last chapter are open ?
that sure can not be the case !
our 2010 report is high critic , but also construct .
this is cover by the first copenhagen criterion .
it is a central issu , becaus it is the polit criterion .
in diplomat term , we need turkey and turkey also need u .
now , everyon can see that it is not .
i am not ask for there to be a decis on turkey 's access .
today , this is veri clear in question .
let u get move !
let u not lose turkey at this stage !
on cyprus , it must stop hide behind what happen in 2004 .
it is alreadi 2011 .
i particular appreci the posit taken by mr füle .
turkey is a great friend of dictat ahmadinejad .
turkey doe not want to be a secular countri ani longer .
instead , it ha opt for the muslim brotherhood of hama .
turkey is increas focus on the islam world .
ladi and gentleman , when are we go to stop this sham ?
europ doe not want turkey and europ doe not want islam .
mr sarkozi ha alreadi said that .
howev , a backward islam cultur ha no place in europ .
how much longer will you continu humili the turkish peopl ?
take the honour way out and stop do that .
pick on cyprus lead turkey nowher .
that this requir a firm approach from everyon involv .
this report is honest - too honest for some .
what wa he expect to find ?
the 2010 progress report is , in realiti , a fault report .
we know that this is what is happen .
a recent survey show how the turk realli see the eu .
we should break off the access negoti a quick a possibl .
turkey is strateg import to u , but not at ani price .
we need to find other method .
the exampl of mor gabriel form part of this issu .
they would , of cours , be oppos to it .
in this case , the languag question take prioriti .
the distinct here concern integr .
we face a giant strateg crisi .
europ lose turkey , and turkey lose europ .
we must intensifi negoti with turkey all the more .
this posit must not , of cours , be abus .
a far a i am concern , this is essenti .
these are just some of the requir for open chapter 23 .
that is what we expect from you .
both side have their homework to do .

we therefor need a clearer posit .
i have long been a support of turkish access .
i will offer some construct suggest .
this should be guarante by law .
time is run away .
i could speak about this issu for a long time .
the lack of religi freedom is particular evid .
unfortun , it is now a littl too late .
a you have seen , mr cashman ha alreadi left the chamber .
the turkey issu is close link to that .
we regard turkey a an import euro-atlant partner .
it neighbour also need to make their move in this direct .
howev , i would like to say one thing in conclus .
in my opinion , that would be honest on our part .
some import chapter remain block for turkey .
a candid countri can not occupi european union territori .
madam presid , the report is rather given to understat .
i quot , signific effort are need on fundament right ' .
the law is still in place .
but let me make it absolut clear .
this is veri import , particular chapter 23 .
let me make a person comment .
chapter 23 and 15 are among those be frozen unilater .
but let me also make the follow comment .
we are talk about a strateg partner here .
let me be frank with you .
howev , let u also think about all that depend on u .

i believ that this will be achiev .
montenegro ha made good progress in the integr process .
obvious , combat corrupt and organis crime remain key .
one of the eu 's key object is environment protect .
one consequ could be to extend the futur access negoti .
one is the qualiti of it neighbourhood relat .

industri polici for the globalis era ( debat )
we must , of cours , focus on a number of specif area .
we also need to pay more attent to resourc .
simpli say that this is import is not enough .
that is a start point for action on raw materi .
the recycl rate for mobil phone is onli 1.5 % .
i would like to make one last point in this context .
innov and resourc product will not happen by themselv .
they depend on the employe who are involv .
what doe have modern industri mean ?
( applaus )
howev , this report can onli repres the first step .
this is all about ad bioethanol to petrol .
we need to have the consum on our side .
that is the central messag .
it wa a taboo subject for everyon el .
europ ha long ceas to be a leader in the area of innov .
it is of fundament import to support innov project .
look at germani , look at china , look at spain .
do you think you could interven , commission ?
i think the answer is yes .
first , the cultur of innov and entrepreneurship .
these are two key issu .
particular attent should be paid to young entrepreneur .
these two thing go hand in hand .
modern industri polici is so much more than that .
i will mention just some of them .
third , the transit to a low carbon economi is a key step .
so the linkag between innov skill and sustain is evid .
last , one element miss for me is the digit agenda .
( de ) madam presid , i have a question for mr reul .
i believ that industri polici is part of the chang .
tomorrow , his collabor method will be crown with success .
ladi and gentleman , we must use these mean to financ it .
industri polici is make a comeback .
these three form the core .
industri polici can not function without an integr market .
what must we do ?
we have to act and to protect ourselv .
i would therefor like to make three propos .
the first relat to industri standard .
the second concern educ and research .
we must reconcil the public with scienc .
we have eur 30 billion to spend in 2011 , 2012 and 2013 .
the third is fund .
we could creat a european industri invest fund .
i have a suggest to make .
i share the view on monetari polici .
let u be veri cautious about exit the crisi .
in europ , we can boast excel in mani field .
just look how clever and clean the eu 2020 strategi is !
howev , i do have one concern , and that is globalis .
this is not a european veto .
it will continu .
a you know , commission , manag mean look ahead .
second , materi manag .
i have a few critic and propos to make .
my second consider is the lack of ani innov financ propos .
it is , unfortun , necessari to act in time and quick .
if it were not financ , it would remain empti word .
in vote this morn , we face up to that .
third , this strategi protect our industri .
it is for exchang found on reciproc and balanc .
sever articl focus on these issu .
to this end , howev , we will need the entir innov chain .
furthermor , we must encourag synergi within the sector .
there are mani posit point in it , which i strong support .
we must take innov small busi and help them grow .
energi consumpt is an industri product indic .
it ha been a pleasur work on this report .
everi one of the particip want to add someth to it .
we believ that social dialogu can not be circumv .
i think that what we need is a balanc european economi .
those of u on the agricultur side would say the veri same .
so i think this is an import report on all front .
this is good news .
we can also work on find substitut for rare raw materi .
we need practic , sensibl measur .
the debat is close .
written statement ( rule 149 )
a conflict of interest is appar here .
a sound industri polici is need , but not econom nation .
secur europ 's suppli of rare earth element ( debat )
the next item is the debat on :
madam presid , commission , ladi and gentleman .
the question to the commiss are direct and urgent :
if it is an effici use of resourc , they will do so .
we should also use the aid-for-trad mechan .
we are still look for these suggest .
no area of our polici must therefor be neglect .
what is the ratio between these three possibl ?
then i will talk about the relationship with china .
work on clarifi this is alreadi in progress .
there are a number of reason for this .
there have also been environment and work environ disput .
first , the wto .
do we have a procedur at the wto regard rare earth ?
is there a role for greenland ?
what is the precis think in this respect ?
third , the recoveri of rare earth from recycl .
will there be a direct or a regul ?
what is plan in this respect ?
there are opportun for cooper in this area .
japan ha also react more quick and more effect .
it goe without say that we need trade polici .
we need mandatori target for raw materi effici .
we also need specif , concret plan for recycl ree .
the commiss 's communic make no direct mention of recycl .
substitut is anoth key factor .
this must not continu .
we need an intern agreement .
the commiss should therefor play the role of mediat here .
this is known a the coloni reflex ' .
is it your directorate-gener ?
is it you ?
is it the directorate-gener for trade ?
is it mr de gucht ?
is it the other commission ?
who realli ha overal respons ?
what concret step must be taken ?
they are therefor vital to new clean energi a well .
( applaus )
perhap we could even start produc them ourselv .
that is veri import .
we need to increas collect .
will you look at that issu a well ?
that seem to me to be veri import .

possibl of use gas from altern sourc in europ ( debat )
until a few year ago , the usa wa an import of gas .
i am not draw ani conclus from this develop at the moment .
it is also in the interest of some member state .
all of these thing have to be taken into consider .
in germani , howev , there is also the issu of accept .
we must follow up these develop without prejudg them .
i will permit myself to ask two question .
we take note of and welcom that .
i am interest to hear your answer .
what can we see ?
we can also see air pollut .
and you talk of social accept ?
there is genuin rebellion .
and you say , it is an econom opportun ' .
but whom doe this gas benefit ?
are we talk about cui bono ?
the new york moratorium is a good illustr of the problem .
we are therefor simpli request that the licenc be revok .
the situat on the market ha also chang .
let u hope that we - europ - do not wast this opportun .
of cours , we must focus on the effici use of gas .
europ is the region with the greatest buy power .
we also need to consid the import of pipelin in futur .
a pipelin is rather like a marriag .
in fact , we are alreadi benefit from this .
the commiss is propos to review the regulatori framework .
thank you veri much .
the bioga market is also one of best develop in europ .
thank you for your attent .
this should primarili be the task of the commiss .
we therefor urgent need to diversifi our energi sourc .
i would like to share three fact with you on this matter .
i think it is good news for our colleagu .
shale gas is an opportun to be a part of the solut .
one differ certain exist compar to the unit state .
europ 's popul densiti is much higher than in the u .
just one exampl of this is mobil .
in the new member state , the figur is below 200 .
third , our own deposit of gas are shrink .
in addit , a lot of our hope are , of cours , pin on gas .
whi is this ?
this make it clear that we need gas .
this will result in a depend level of 80 % .
this process is onli just begin .
whi might this be the case ?
i have fundament confid in the nation govern .
i do not distrust them .
there is room for improv in the european regul .
that is true in all area .
it appli to the quota for woman and it also appli here .
for this reason , we will investig the possibl for improv .

we can and we have to respond in a strateg and unit way .
( applaus )
howev , we are not a militari union .
can we stand asid whilst innoc civilian are massacr ?
we are face an enorm challeng .
we have to deal with wide differ develop .
we can not speak of a uniform process .
gaddafi is a crimin .
he is a murder who belong befor an intern crimin court .
we have to make a choic , includ in what we say here .
that is what our conscienc say to u .
that would be danger .
you can not make these trite demand and then do noth !
i think three thing are necessari in this messag .
what they need is a no-fli zone .
those are the three key element that are necessari today .
this messag must be sent today to that region .
let u be frank .
for year , we have fail to do that .
so you have now ceas negoti with colonel gaddafi ?
mazel tov !
are you serious ?
do you realli think you could have carri on ?
( applaus )
today , a nation ha risen up .
it ha repres .
two thing are need .
yet they are say : we want a no-fli zone ' .
the african union is talk about a no-fli zone .
the arab leagu is talk about a no-fli zone .
therefor , it is not nato .
this mean that colonel gaddafi is complet isol .
it say to him : you have no futur , you have no chanc ! '
how can it be achiev ?
there are countless idea .
there are option .
this is a polit act that we must carri out .
( applaus )

last , food aid and militari aid are need , too .
let u ensur that what happen in bosnia is not repeat .

no , it is one side against the other here .
we should let them come to europ !
( applaus )
now , of cours , he stand accus of terroris his own peopl .
that ha not happen , of cours .
i therefor want to make myself veri clear .
this ha been spoken of clear here .
that is a fact !
we can imagin what it will mean if gaddafi succeed .
resolut action is need now .
we are on the side of the democrat revolut .
there is a share of the workload here at the intern level .
we certain do not want that .
thank you veri much .
the peopl are call for freedom and better live condit .
first , the humanitarian emerg .
a civil war is take place in libya .
here , mr cohn-bendit , we have mr berlusconi .
you do not have to hug them .
you do not have to charm them .
this must be the appropri respons for europ at this time .
we have to recognis them .
my last point concern humanitarian issu .
we have need 25 year to reach the same conclus today .
those kiss , of cours , were not entir without foundat .
they were justifi with the word stabil ' .
in a few day , a summit is to be held .
we expect it to produc result .
we can not afford to lose anoth 25 year .
our problem is not that we do not understand the time .
we often say the right thing here .
our problem is that we are slow to act .
our problem is that what we do is not effect .
thank you .
what are the specif step need to de-legitimis gaddafi ?
we must come up with a suitabl european financi plan .
this is also obvious go to happen .
we must help them achiev this .

of cours they are done in conjunct with our partner .
the arab leagu will discus a no-fli zone on saturday .
of cours .
there are pictur of mani peopl .
we may not like that , and it is a genuin debat .
isol is effect in some circumst , but engag is better .
i want to just also say someth about label .
no , let u not do that .
one final thing about public and listen .
i have been wall to wall on the airwav .
mr presid , perhap baro ashton could comment on this .
she ha not repli on that point .
mani speaker have rais it .
there are two reason that i did not repli .
that is our question .
my person opinion do not count in this .

muammar gaddafi 's departur is a matter of urgenc today .
at the moment , that opposit is veri weak .
we do not even have a plan a , let alon a plan b .
it wa a principl of solidar .
for sure it will be larg and veri signific for malta .
it should not be replac by uncoordin measur .
moreov , this realloc ha no ration basi .
it is rough equal .
the problem is not how much we spend but how we spend .
we are thus not perform self-sacrific here .
an amend of articl 136 ( 3 ) of the treati ha been propos .
we should not forget that in this debat .
who shall establish them and how ?
i know that some of you are disappoint with this approach .
i have to say , the commiss share your disappoint .
whi do we need this legal certainti ?
it is like pay into an insur polici which never pay out .
it is critic that we get it right .
we should therefor consid veri care what we do .
we are in close contact with the rapporteur .
we have decid not to have a final vote today .
all the speaker agre with him .
what there wa - or not - wa the merkel-sarkozi pact .
that awaken my mistrust and a certain degre of sceptic .
one wonder what planet herr brok live on .

there is no mandat , mr duff .
there is no mandat for this .
doe he not know of the excess deficit posit of the uk ?
and i am , by god !
i wa right in spade , wa i not ?

this is not such a wild idea .

is it becaus the amend of the treati is unimport ?
no , quit the contrari in fact .
so , what will be the result of the amend of the treati ?
thank you for give me the floor .
that is not the case .
the problem in these countri is structur shortcom .
thank you , mr presid .
that is the start point .
a wish list ha been put forward in this regard .
that would be a sensibl approach .
howev , we should definit not stop there .
mr presid , i have three point .
first , deficit are not caus by currenc .
they are caus by govern and overspend .
the respons lie with govern .
( pt ) i can summaris my posit in three point .
we should therefor support it unreserv .
a danger preced is be set here .
it is a rescu mechan .
that is what we ask for .
it is not about ani disput between the institut .
it is not about gain power for parliament .
thank you .
that said , i would like to underlin three point .
realism ha today led u to revis it .
i have drawn two conclus from this .
at the same time , these packag do overlap .

the citizen of the european union deserv equal opportun .
assum respons is requir at a macro-region level a well .
we must accept respons on our border .
europ must be abl to react to rapid chang in the world .
we are in an unusu situat .
could we call ourselv good european if we did not do this ?
we have even frame this in law .
lívia járóka ha alreadi done this .
i am convinc that we need this common action plan .
even the sun wa blot out from our vision .

vote time now continu .
explan of vote
oral explan of vote
what i would like to do is to offer a construct suggest .
but let u have one seat , one way or the other .
the score is therefor brussel 1 strasbourg 1 .
this direct bring forward a differ decis .
that is whi i abstain in the vote .
it is also veri import to consid the situat in cyprus .
we could have reason pursu one of two polici .
we have made promis which we have no intent of fulfil .
now , look at it from ankara 's point of view .
they deserv better than this .
this hous therefor found the right line .
it is a grand delus that we must final step away from .
first , it is a resolut which is import for croatia .
thing have to go on then , too , but how ?
first of all , there is macedonia , and then montenegro .
i look forward alreadi to the negoti with montenegro !
it is therefor good that we have this report .
it is move in the right direct for the rom .
thank you , mr presid .
for these reason , i vote against the rest of my group .
this inadequaci need to be rectifi a soon a possibl .
the strategi actual aim at inclus and not mere integr .
the rom question is a paradox one for europ in mani sen .
that is whi we need to invest in educ in particular .
all the member state and eu institut are respons for this .
kali sarakosti : happi lent to you all .
( sk ) mr presid , we are talk about rom integr issu .
we have not yet overcom these differ .
( fi ) mr presid , efharisto , thank you .
this report by mr járóka is an excel one .
now is the time to ask a fundament question .
this is the way to tackl this issu proper and success .
one controversi point remain : the european patent .
it is just such invest which today 's economi need .
thank you .
therefor , i fulli support the resolut .
now that is someth my countri would not agre with .
thank you .
whi is that ?
for the purpos of research and develop activ .
this will enabl u to creat skill job .
that is the case with euskadi , the basqu countri .
make use of the region ' knowledg .
written explan of vote
it is what your sharehold want .
what businessman in his right mind would keep two factori ?
it will also send a posit signal to our elector .
that amend is quit simpli a violat of the treati !
the support of the alsac seat must speak out more .
the democrat mep vote against that decis .
i vote in favour of this report .
eu institut need to a well .
this is an auster budget which stay in line with inflat .
remark , one prioriti is a european hous of histori .
such self-indulg must end .
we have chosen to support this budget report .
at present , there are unaccept omiss in both area .
that is whi i support mr fernand by vote in favour .
this threshold mean exercis great respons .
i support this request .
the treati of lisbon ha given parliament new respons .
that is whi i vote a i did .
i vote in favour .
for these reason , i vote against the budget report .
the eu , too , should reduc it expenditur .
i therefor vote against this report .
a real effort need to be made toward consolid .
that , too , must chang .
i support this resolut .
we therefor did not vote in favour .
we therefor did not vote in favour .
that is whi i vote a i did .
i vote in favour of this resolut .
when will we have the courag to get out of this trap ?
we therefor abstain from vote on amend 38 .
that should be a central point in this resolut .
the text is veri balanc .
and which complet fail to learn from this !
then he should say so clear and act accord .
these are the fact .
the union , howev , should also take a look in the mirror .
turkey is a strong econom actor .
this can not be ignor .
negoti with turkey should be given a boost .
turkish colonis and occupi troop are still on the island .
this resolut lectur turkey on democraci .
such lectur are inappropri .
and what about integr between the union and turkey ?
there are other fundament issu .
most of turkey is not geograph part of europ .
it is also total reliabl within nato .
given the circumst , howev , what el could be expect ?
it is realli time to come clean with turkey .
the european union need turkey and turkey need the eu .
normalis of relat with cyprus is anoth import issu .
it is import to reach a peac solut to the conflict .
i vote in favour of the report , becaus it is well balanc .
it reflect well the state of turkey 's eu integr in 2010 .
i have alway agre with turkish membership .
for these reason , i vote against the report .
further step are necessari , howev .
the pace certain need to be step up , too .
turkey clear lag behind expect .
turkey remain one of the eu 's most import partner .
the independ of the medium should also be a concern .
this resolut concern the case of montenegro .
i vote in favour of this resolut .
the access of new state depend on various factor .
this time , it is montenegro 's turn .
now the promis are huge .
this is whi we have out doubt about this process .
we must not underestim this .
montenegro 's fate , meanwhil , is entir in it own hand .
nobodi like to be led by the nose for too long .
i want no part of it . i shall vote against .
i therefor vote for this motion for a resolut .
the report address all relev polici field .
the most import are paragraph 23 , 24 and 32 .
approxim 10-12 million rom resid in the european union .
mani suffer discrimin and social exclus .
that is whi i vote in favour of this text .
the rom situat in the eu is rather complic .
for this reason , i support this report .
rom inclus is a matter for europ .
i have therefor vote against the report .
howev , no one must expect chang to occur quick .
the eu fund are there .
they must be use in a way that will benefit the rom .
parliament ha adopt a good text .
the rom should therefor be involv in ani decis make .
rare ha a european parliament report come so close to mad .
these are all area in which action is need .
the rom need to be involv in make polici .
the rom are cultur one of the richest nation in the world .
we are afraid of what we do not know .
otherwis , the financi resourc will be wast .
this resolut is pure talk , yet again .
this confus approach is unaccept .
decis step must be taken to bring discrimin to an end .
i vote for the report on the eu strategi on rom inclus .
howev , much remain to be done to prevent discrimin .
that is whi i strong reject the report .
integr is not a one-way street .
i therefor vote against the report .
it is schedul to be adopt by the council befor the summer .
deindustrialis is an establish fact in europ .
this is the thrust of this resolut , which i endors .
i vote in favour of this report .
it must also support it product sector and it sme base .
there is no miracl solut to this .
onli the excel of european industri can make this happen .
we hope that we are capabl of rise to the challeng .
the import of european industri is indisput .
this is anoth report that is full of contradict .
howev , the report insist on advoc these polici .
it endors them , while ignor their effect .
that is whi we vote against .
i therefor vote in favour .
the recent profound econom crisi ha hit european industri .
a singl job in industri creat at least two more job .
i consid these measur to be absolut necessari .
correct to vote and vote intent : see minut
the sit is suspend at 13:45 and shall resum at 15:00 .

eu approach toward iran ( debat )
the result is someth that we can be proud of .
the resolut also goe into iran 's role in the region .
and build confid is what our effort are all about .
iran 's respons wa disappoint .
it spoke of the remov of all sanction .
i understand iran 's wish to see sanction remov .
that wa the path we were tri to go down .
i want the death penalti abolish , whatev the method .
stone and public hang are barbar .
i saw that in the case of m ashtiani .
both the execut and the process lead up to it were shock .
i look forward to this debat .
no one in the world want the iranian bomb .
we have made wide-rang offer .
unfortun , they have not met with a posit respons .
iran 's attitud to israel remain intoler and unaccept .
larg part of the region are in fear of iran 's polici .
it is also a contradictori exampl a regard polit freedom .
a list of 80 name ha been leak and attribut to your offic .
the human right situat in iran is intoler .
iran is natur an import player in the middl east .
they did so at the risk of their own live .
we need to extend a help hand to them against the regim .
whi do we have to do so ?
are we still pay attent to the fate of mr karoubi ?
i want to pay sincer tribut to these brave woman .
the list can go on .
it is incred and hard to believ .
the exampl of libya is a case in point .
the european parliament must speak about this .
on the contrari - thing are even wors .
it is the right line to take .
i will make that my last point .
we are allow ourselv to be manipul .
is anyon analys current event in this respect ?
i suggest we consid this .
what can we do about this ?
we have a respons to protect them .
christian liter have no life under ahmadinejad .
what is more , he oppress his own peopl in an appal way .
never have so mani peopl been execut a over the last year .
the ahmadinejad regim can not be tackl hard enough .
i look forward to the day that this regim fall .
today would not be soon enough !
woman human right defend are particular at risk in iran .
that is not democraci , m ashton .
mr presid , i do not want to take up too much time .
i repeat that this is about democraci .
i repres five million peopl .
i have been elect here .
baro ashton ha not receiv a vote in her life .
they must , of cours , come from within iran .
turkey is an import partner for the european union .
the second matter is cooper with russia .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
democrat chang can not be impos from outsid .
true , this chang can not be impos from outsid .
this is possibl but le probabl .
it would be a long road but the onli sensibl one for iran .
i congratul mr belder on an excel report .
the victim of this abandon are thus intern mind student .
iran 's nuclear ambit are also endang the popul .
this is more than with ani one other countri .
that is moral wrong and to the eu 's shame .
madam high repres , let u not forget these sore tri peopl .
a far a that goe , i am veri mind of my respons .
i am tri to continu to get that clarif .
it is for them to choos .
i listen veri attent to what you had to say .
for me , it is ident .
that is certain someth that is close to my heart .
this also benefit the region in term of overal secur .
the debat is close .
the vote will take place at midday on thursday , 10 march .
i also emphasis that human right are univers .
we hope this mission will be dispatch without delay .
but in the end , these are onli input .
what truli matter are the output .
the real test is whether we make a differ on the ground .
this is a key object of the ongo review process .
we will continu to push for an ambiti result .
we look forward to work with her .
this is a veri import preced .
they can inde .
this time is signific for anoth reason .
it must also be will to listen and abl to compromis .
so to my last point : the eu 's perform .
we are talk the talk , but not walk the walk .
plea adopt a more fundament polici on this issu .
it work programm is hard and extraordinarili import .
( the presid interrupt the speaker )
thank you .
the human right council is on the right track here .
( the presid interrupt the speaker )
social , cultur , civil and polit right on an equal foot .
veri well .
we should not be fatalist , howev .
i would like to stress this and to commend you for this .
well , first you stress the univers of human right .
i am veri plea that we are on the same wavelength .
i am veri plea that you stress this .
there is a chanc that a region council will be establish .
thank you veri much .
it is becaus she is a woman .
yesterday wa woman 's day . this wa not rais here .
this hous disgrac itself .
it vote down an amend not to fund infanticid .
not to fund coerciv abort .
when are we go to be abl to discus this issu ?
it is not a taboo subject ; this is a democraci .
it is more than i receiv from her in relat to my view .
plea let u have respect debat in this hous .
mr presid , of cours i respect mr mitchel 's view .
we can have disagr in other area .
i am not an ogr ; i am not someth from the past .
i thank the member for what they have said .
we , a europ , must make sure that we are up to the job .
we need to be fair and consist .
do declar by these countri carri ani weight ?
to make this possibl , we will need to act quick .
howev , it would be unfair to singl out just libya .
the 3 400 peopl there are suffer psycholog tortur .
this is a breach of their human right .
i hear the critic that are made of it .
that is what we are do at the present time .
i apologis that i did not answer on camp ashraf .
i intend to , but i turn the paper over too quick .
they assur me that the basic need are be met .
we do inde - henc i know about the week report .
i talk with the team while i wa in geneva .
i think that is probabl right .
there are no other criterion that should appli .
one is resourc , inevit .
the debat is close .
the vote will take place at midday on thursday , 10 march .
written statement ( rule 149 )
regrett , this is not the realiti .
there is no practic altern to eu value-bas foreign polici .
it is a rough deris of democraci and human right .
i chair the quartet meet in munich on 5 februari .
i urg and hope that this will happen soon .
this is clear unaccept .
thus , i do not want to criticis you , baro ashton .
we all know veri well that time is now run out .
it also had a benefici effect .
this is , in fact , a veri serious matter .
whi is it that all we hear about is money ?
we have paid and paid , and that is import .
twenti nine peopl were kill , mani hundr were injur .
you spoke about direct negoti .
you gave me the answer .
there must be an end to both .
now is not the time for pusillanim and tentat deal .
now they have collaps .
howev , non-intervent is not enough .
settlement develop must be stop .
i hope that we recognis the elect .
we must instead recognis the democrat develop .
( de ) mr presid , the contrast is strike !
we are tri to help .
we have discus libya today .
in recent day and week , we have discus egypt and tunisia .
i should like to make this veri clear .
you occasion have to endur critic from this hous , too .
for this reason , some prais is perhap also in order .
it is mere that these chang have not yet come to an end .
democratis must succeed here too .
the arab peopl are watch u .
wholesal chang are take place in the middl east .
we must also admit that the neighbourhood polici ha fail .
we current spend eur 1.5 billion per year on this polici .
we must ass the tangibl benefit of this .
unfortun , the prospect are not rosi .
can you confirm whether that will be the case ?
that child 's parent want peac .
they also want the settlement to stop .
simpli to stop them .
not to dismantl them .
to stop them .
quit someth !
she is right , of cours .
israel ha play for time .
high repres , you have the power to make a differ .
what is this about ?
you are put your trust in pleasant dialogu .
but israel just think we are weak , weak , weak .
that word is no ' .
it is pretti obvious that ha not work .
we must do the same for the ark royal .
i dedic those word to mr ashton .
we should make the most of this type of opportun .
natur , the safe bet for everyon would be to wait and see .
the european union is predestin for this role .
it ha help civil societi in the middl east .
iran also constitut a threat to the veri exist of israel .
egypt get closer to iran is a veri alarm trend .
i am sick of it .
i have heard it enough .
i do not criticis member here for say it .
our posit is absolut clear .
i wa veri well awar of that .
i am not sure whether the elect will now go ahead .
that will be for them to decid .
i know that they are think about the best way forward .
i think it had two effect .
one is , of cours , great concern about what wa go on .
so it had an interest effect on rais the debat .
we have to get move .
there are two reason for this .
i think it is the interest of both .
i speak with amr moussa on this subject .
i will see him again in cairo .
mr lambsdorff , thank you for your comment .
i am tri to make sure that we make progress on that .
i feel veri strong that we have play an import part .
i do not mind where we meet the envoy .
for me , that realli matter .
i appreci that .
so , get that to happen matter .
eur 5.3 million is what it will cost .
we can do it and we are readi to roll .
so that is my particular refer for kerem shalom .
we look at karni .
it is not actual for my servic .
it is le than 50 % of the british foreign offic 's budget .
we talk about the opportun that we have there .
they will tell me about thing they do not like .
we do not have a margin role .
we have a realist role .
i can not do what other countri can do .
m dodd ask whether the neighbourhood polici had fail .
i said a long time ago that we need to review the polici .
stefan füle and i have start that work .
i thank marc ott for his contribut .
final , mr swoboda , you ask me about the iranian ship .
permiss wa given for it to go through on that basi .
honour member , thank you veri much for this debat .
the debat is close .
written statement ( rule 149 )
the manag of drink water is one exampl of this .
on the contrari , they are an opportun to be seiz .
the eu must take the initi to relaunch them .

( the sit close at 18:20 )
open of the sit
( the sit wa open at 09:00 )
respect of nation wage and retirement-set mechan ( debat )
it is not eu action in the respect field .
ireland went down a similar road in the 1980s .
we must prune the tree in order to allow growth .
we do not need the straw to break the camel 's back .
i do not believ that this interfer can be justifi .
if not , plea stop this nonsens now .
it is in contradict with articl 153 .
whi is it that one euro wa deduct from the minimum wage ?
citizen see what is happen .
final my main question , commission , is : who decid ?
is it the court of justic ?
this blunt approach inspir euro-sceptic .
such a posit is utter unaccept .
wage polici is not the busi of the eu .
it state that wage should reflect market condit .
this is like a blind man describ an eleph .
of cours wage can not be equal .
i am not surpris : this is the eu at work .
commission , you have the same nation a me .
absolut noth !
they said this countri is a wonder exampl ' .
all of that ha now complet collaps .
these two thing do not go togeth .
they need to be much stronger .
we then need clear benchmark that actual appli to everyon .
we need econom govern .
in our view , there is no contradict here .
that is total and utter nonsens .
it is not support by practic on the ground .
it is not grow .
you may be unhappi with that , but that is go to happen .
this will continu the fight against these antisoci polici .
how ha the general feel toward the eu chang ?
the european union , the commiss and the council ...
( the presid cut off the speaker )
the european commiss ha quit simpli redrawn the map .
this is sure not what it is all about .
one of the patient is greec .
the respons state this veri emphat .
plea read it .
that will make the peopl of europ realli veri unhappi .
my fellow member ha just mention this .
you are chip away at codetermin .
you are weaken the trade union .
( applaus )
how is that suppos to happen ?
in other word , we should do the opposit .
it is not obvious that we can achiev this align .
the clear dispar can be seen between romania and germani .
inde , such discrep can not be made up overnight .
european citizen also depend on public pension .
these propos are downright unfair , to say the veri least .
we can not accept this .
i sincer hope ...
( the presid cut off the speaker )
where are these antieu feel come from ?
the feel is that pay flexibl might help in some way .
it will not : on the contrari , it will result in deflat .
the peopl are protest .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
they provid for condit link to the grant of union assist .
this is explicit allow by articl 122 ( 2 ) .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
the debat is close .

the import of this issu wa outlin .
two year later , and where is this list ?
this report put forward a set of import recommend .
which step have alreadi been taken in this area ?
which step will they take next ?
we need to be ambiti .
we all know that invest in disast prevent pay off .
we are now ass the effect of exist eu financ instrument .
we also need clear and transpar ass of the risk we face .
that is central to european integr .
the second keyword that we must mention here is speed .
what can we do at eu level ?
prevent is key .
mr presid , this is a recur debat in parliament .
moreov , the fund mechan also need to be improv .
we need to know where the train emerg servic team are .
the commiss must come forward with these plan now .
tomorrow 's disast may be just around the corner .
( fi ) mr presid , we can endors what ha been said here .
disast have just continu to increas in number .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
( the presid cut off the speaker )
i know it ha not been appli proper in my countri .
countri have to take respons just the same a the commiss .
by work togeth , we can at least allevi the difficulti .
it is also import ...
( the presid cut off the speaker )
this also need to be taken into account .
discus to this effect are also ongo within the commiss .
the debat is close .
written statement ( rule 149 )

volcan ash crisi ( debat )
the next item is the debat :
to be frank , mr presid , member state bottl it last year .
but , mr presid , that wa then .
what about the futur ?
i will now tri to chang my speech somewhat .
it wa inde chao - mr simpson ha alreadi said that .
we realis that there were too few agreement in place .
we then set up a task forc .
i do not know of ani at least .
there is also someth el that caus me concern .
that can , of cours , help in such case .
we can not predict this , of cours .
it will just happen .
perhap we should also revis these passeng right onc more .
there are a lot of question here .
you will notic that this subject is of great concern to u .
in principl , of cours , this ha it basi in law .
thank you .
this make europ a stronger partner at a global level .
this process must be repeat when import chang occur .
this must be reflect in the safeti risk ass .
we must learn lesson from such an event .
this question ha come up veri often .
anoth import factor a far a we are concern is the passeng .
it is not just a question of explain their right .
that could work .
it can work , too .
we will then be abl to regul this within twelv month .
but i wa , like other , a victim of the ash cloud .
this concern all european citizen .
we all agre on that .
( the presid interrupt the speaker )
for exampl , how about improv our common measur system ?
we need to be clear about that .
in all this chao , one thing wa clear .
i welcom the comment by the commission today .
let u hope that we move forward now in a posit way .
we need and must achiev greater progress in this area .
i would ask the commiss to look at this a well .
a you see , noth actual work .
when will there be an effect common european airspac ?
what is the altern plan ?
what mean of transport are to be use ?
this time , peopl were at a loss .
this is an issu that the commiss need be more effect on .
safeti had absolut prioriti , and right so .
i can not understand the critic direct at the airlin .
that decis must be made at a polit level .
safeti must be given top prioriti .
it must also be the case in the futur , too .
that is obvious .
it wa a step in the right direct .
each of u in this chamber wa direct affect .
peopl have said that this could happen again .
i think that is the over situat that we should support .
the time for discus is end .
thank you veri much .
after all , they have put their signatur to it .
we have regul ( ec ) no 2061 from 2004 .
what doe the commiss intend to do in this regard ?
unfortun , there is no suitabl medicin for such a situat .
thank you .
we should work togeth to resolv this issu , too .
therefor , i would like to conclud by state the follow .
this will be of benefit to all citizen in europ .
it is our intent to revis air passeng right in 2012 .

madam presid , i vote , of cours , for this resolut .
we ad this call to our resolut .
madam presid , i vote in favour of the resolut .
he ha commit a crime against human .
this they made quit clear .
there are poster up all over benghazi say so .
third , we can not afford it .
i think we have done quit enough .
it is not enough , howev , to adopt a resolut .
the armi did not want to interfer at first .
the onli winner in such an eventu would be mr ahmadinejad .
we should support more opposit in iran .
the humanitarian situat there is intoler .
what wa the signatur act of the revolut ?
it wa the sieg of the u embassi .
unfortun , this human right resolut wa not wellbalanc .
but i have a short explan to make .
written explan of vote

let me turn now to libya and the southern neighbourhood .
colonel gaddafi must relinquish power immedi .
so what kind of action ha the council taken ?
first let me mention the sanction .
what el did the council do besid sanction ?
they agre that the eu ha suffici oil and gas stock .
let me mention what ha happen on evacu .
i will stop there .
i am sorri if my speech wa a bit too long .
this is the principl of 11 march 2011 .
fiscal consolid is not an end in itself .
without fiscal consolid there is no confid .
without confid there are no invest .
without invest there is no growth .
for that we also need to improv the busi environ .
we need to complet the intern market .
we also have to do more to foster employ .
we need more labour mobil , not le mobil .
now negoti will start with parliament .
our fellow citizen have wit japan 's drama unfold live .
this is our duti a neighbour .
the pact for the euro should also be adopt on friday .
you deserv to be congratul on that .
( applaus )
i can not share your cheer ahead of this summit .

we do not need to help them ' .
four month later : a bail-out .
we do not need a rescu packag .
the amount we have made avail is enough . '
four month later : we need more money ' .
we do not want eurobond .
eurobond are nonsens . '
now everyon is discus eurobond .
eurobond will come - of that i am quit sure .
perhap in four month ' time .
we do not need econom govern .
europ doe not need econom govern . '
i hope so and we support you in it , mr barroso .
that is the realiti .
there is a crucial differ .
that is the problem that we are grappl with in europ .
we have embark upon the wrong cours .
the euro is a strong currenc .
on it introduct the euro wa worth usd 1.17 .
look at what it is worth today .
that is the realiti with which we are confront .
i hope that everyth will go well at the weekend .
i hope that what you have announc will be implement .
i hope that we will come back from a success summit .
( applaus )
will this pact realli creat econom govern ?
these are not my word .
what doe it say ?
the council hold all the power .
i know they will say no .
they alway say no .
this is the first thing i want to say .
this wa our first reaction in the eu bodi .
this goe against the treati of lisbon .
did they do this ?
third , look at what we are wit now .
some outrag decis have been made within the eu institut .
is that the eu 's posit ?
they are tell them to stay calm and be care .
let me speak clear .
this ha all gone too far and must be stop .
we must not let this happen again .
that is clear .
our fellow citizen know all this .
they know this and they sen it .
they know that these radic chang are also complex .
we need to start somewher .
we alway start by make the labour market more flexibl .
we have seen how useless the previous stress test were .
everyth wa fine suppos , even in ireland .
in fact , no new polit concept are in sight .
that is not the same a a sustain budget .
if there is no consumpt , then product will also collaps .
this mean speed up the polici of econom govern in europ .
unfortun , the market are our current problem .
we must focus on young peopl .
that is what we must now stop .
this indebted must end .
the pact for the euro involv too littl communiti method .
that ha been said here , and quit right so .
i share this view .
i would like to say a final word about libya .
the council ha support resolut 1973 .
we must now look to the futur .
i would like to warn those who want to hurri .
at least , that is what i see happen on europ 's road .
my second question is a follow .
this is about show genuin european empathi .
( nl ) madam presid , i thought that you had overlook me .
thank you for give me the floor .
major deficit have not been tackl .
those countri , madam presid , should leav the eurozon .
thank you .
it is true : this is the fourth packag in a few month .
you refus to negoti , but you present no altern .
we have manag to stop colonel gaddafi from reach benghazi .
howev , europ 's lack of uniti is worri .
histori is on the move in much of the world .
we have a stabil and growth pact .
the penalti remain subject to polit decision-mak .
that is unbeliev .
mr presid , i want to consid two issu .
so there is a lack of logic and a lack of consist .
a few word on libya and the southern mediterranean .
we need to follow two step .
this is the second symbol of tomorrow .
well , 24 march see the birth of the brussel consensus ' .
none of u want further crise , but they could happen .
the eu ha also been involv in this .
on the contrari , they came too late .
the west wait too long .
and what did we see ?
franc and britain - two nation state - took the lead .
my congratul !
reagan wa right all along .
there is a sea chang under way in the arab world .
we must not make ani mistak here .
( applaus )
are we awar ?
they say that it is better to be outsid the euro area .
they are wrong .
this reduc my countri 's influenc .
it should be possibl for sweden to be so , too .
this is the free world of the usa .
this is the european union of democraci and freedom .
the p govern wa a spectacular failur .
it is to this that i should like an answer .
is it not lust for power lead them to take this attitud ?
we also need to tackl two other issu .
my second point is libya .
final , i would like to turn to the euro pact .
i think that we have , inde , taken import step forward .
this will not realli be resolv tomorrow .
howev , we have a new govern and new hope in ireland .
we would like to see that reduc by at least 1 % to 2 % .
what is the quid pro quo ?
it is also a challeng for the entir intern communiti .
we should rememb this advic and be care to heed it .
after all , they are our neighbour .
the next eu summit can further strengthen this process .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
this is a real success stori .
the whole of europ may lose if there is a delay .
i congratul mr brok and mr gualtieri on today 's report .

this is what we must put an end to .
this is whi we need joint solut .
this is distinguish between good and bad debt .
is there such a thing a good debt ?
this is a veri excit debat .
thus this in itself wa a posit messag for the market .
so , we have come a long way and in a posit direct .
it is not an exclus club .
we are not one hundr per cent unit .
a condit for this wa the start of democrat chang .
by then , un secur council resolut 1973 wa avail .
thank you veri much , madam presid .

we need a second round of stress test to get thing right .
the second key element is independ expertis ' .
in other word , we need independ expert .
otherwis you run the risk of hear onli bias opinion .
i have one final word to add .
i would be a littl more circumspect if i were you .
( fr ) madam presid , a few word on japan .
it is possibl to run europ entir on sustain power .
that should be the subject of our debat today .
henc , the import of the stress test .
first of all : how are we go to establish the criterion ?
how are we go to ensur they are independ ?
what will be the consequ then ?
we recent adopt an energi strategi for europ up to 2020 .
we should also support new technolog .
there are obvious lesson to be learn .
we learn lesson ; we appli them , and we improv safeti .
that is what we must do with the nuclear industri .
that is whi our discus must not be ideolog .
did the respons , implement and supervis system collaps ?

i strong believ that they deserv everi support .
thank you , mr presid .

i would disagre , howev .
i have alway felt comfort on the middl ground .
it is for this reason that i welcom ...
i suggest you do the same .
i am not the right person to deal with on that score .
( interrupt by mr harm )
these are two differ issu .
we have not lower the target for 2020 .
there have been no chang .
i do not regard the treati of lisbon a set in stone .
i have one final point to make .
i listen veri care to what mr davi and mr hall had to say .
they both belong to the same parti .
they both come from the same member state .
yet , a we have heard , they have diametr oppos posit .
i respect that .
part of the process is alway global in natur .
it is veri import that we draw conclus and learn lesson .
this need to be elabor and an appropri propos tabl .
there is no need to hurri but natur the work must start .
inde , we still have much to do in this area .
thank you veri much , mr presid .

i view this a problemat .
perhap the council should consid this issu .
moreov , these programm are not well coordin .
i therefor believ that these figur speak for themselv .
we are therefor endeavour to acceler the legisl work .
i would like to state that this is a veri import question .
let u talk about it and consult .
i think that we should not yet be imagin thing .
it seem to me that everyon is in control of the situat .
repatri , which is the most urgent issu , is proceed .
this doe not mean that there is no need for the legisl .
there is a veri real need for it .

this is a genuin and ongo concern of eu citizen .
i am plea to note that they share our concern .
that is not the problem .
there are probabl other compani that have been subpoena .
at the same time , they have request larg amount of ...
( the presid cut off the speaker )
i think that is wrong .
this is particular the case when it come to person data .
we are not be short-sight here , just pragmat .
howev , privaci ha it limit .
mr presid , contemporari terror is domin by islam terror .

we have come a long way .
we have review the consum acqui .
we may make some small step forward .
i hope we will keep talk , that we will keep discus .
mayb we will produc someth of worth .
the commiss 's propos left quit a lot of room for improv .
it is good that digit good are includ in the propos .
we have inde made a number of improv .
i think we have a serious problem here .
mr presid , ladi and gentleman , this text is import .
this is what this direct will enabl .
obvious , all this is go to upset a few habit .
i welcom the open that ha just been shown in this respect .
i would like to highlight some of the most import matter .
allow me to mention just three exampl .
we are satisfi that this wa taken into account .
what is need here is a legal right of withdraw .
the challeng is to strike the right balanc .
that pictur is wrong .
the initi draft wa a bad one .
i think all colleagu are in tune with that .
it ha been difficult to discus this sensibl in parliament .
one of the two case concern distanc sale contract .
in my opinion , this part of the propos is superflu .
the result wa monstrous .
the solut is of cours more europ , but not ani kind .
today 's world is evid differ .
quit the opposit is true .
undoubt it ha been a great achiev on their part .
therefor it is good progress .
( ga ) i commend mr schwab for bring the work to complet .
of cours it is a compromis , it is not perfect .
problem might also aris with digit product .
the signific of this direct is clear .
the singl intern market requir singl european consum rule .
fuller harmonis at this stage would not have been possibl .
this is whi i believ that we are on the right track .
thank you veri much .
the debat is close .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 .

on the face of it , this look like a veri technic issu .
that bring me to this question of tar sand and oil shale .
i said at the begin that this is not just a technic issu .
these report are avail on the commiss 's websit .
these must final be identifi and made public .
therefor , i am call on the commiss to act quick .
you said that the studi ha been complet .
what are the timelin ?
in fact , the problem with tar sand is not just the emiss .
nevertheless the lack of progress ha been deepli frustrat .
it realli doe feel like timewast on a grand scale .

i would like to make one more point .
we need to continu negoti on this .
inde , after sever year it wa rather overdu .
the aviat industri is massiv import to europ .

nevertheless , we have climb down .

we final need to make this clear .
this is a mistak and i want to be veri clear on this .
i would like to say just one thing .
this will ultim restrict passeng ' choic .
in addit , regulatori converg could promot fair competit .

written statement ( rule 149 )
prepar of 2012 budget ( debat )
flexibl is anoth import subject .
the context of financi consolid is obvious to everybodi .
what then are the most import issu ?
howev , these joint project cost money .
it is not just about moni .
where do we need to spend more money ?
it also mean more unemploy and more social regress .
this is what my group is oppos .
my third point concern climat chang and energi target .
i should like to touch on two fundament matter .
first of all , auster .
auster is not a principl , it is an instrument .
i believ that this is not an auster polici at all .
that can not be what social democrat are aim for .
( da ) madam presid , i would like to thank mr balzani .
thus , this is also a difficult task .
we must find fund for the fusion energi project in 2012 .
we must pay out the money that we have promis .
we must not allow the creation of a temporari budget .
that would have a veri negat effect on the run of the eu .
if we lose sight of this , we will lose credibl .
it is an ambiti , wast and perhap over broad strategi .
what in ani case are suppos to be it prioriti ?
we can , howev , talk about principl .
if they are not do this , they are do wrong .
thank you for your attent .
this resolut send a clear polit messag .
howev , let u not delud ourselv .

howev , that final bill will still have to be paid .
thank you for your attent .
howev , i also have a few critic remark to make .
howev , there is still time .
neither is there a singl mention of cohes polici .
the union 's prioriti need a suitabl level of fund .
the object have also been agre by member state themselv .
the object show u the direct we ought to choos .
the success of europ depend on how we fulfil them .
all member state can profit from this equal .
the eu budget larg cover invest in the futur of europ .
it should be like that .
for the administr , auster is a must .
she wa talk about cut it .
it ha it logic , a so clear explain by mr gerbrandi .
the logic is all about the matur of programm with time .
this is not surpris .
this is our credibl .
even in time of auster , you have to pay your electr bill .
this is realli about our credibl .
this is about cohes .
this is precis what the european semest is for .
the debat is close .

it may be that you heard that from the interpret .
i would like that to be correct .
refuge should not be punish for cross border .
europ must not becom a fortress .
asylum seeker must not becom victim of our system .
there are provis that need care attent .
such word leav the door wide open to abus .
the same appli to the concept of safe countri of origin .
this is not someth that the commiss just came up with .
this is a veri good start .
it is the cornerston of the futur system .
the propos reform are along these line .
we are colegisl .
the debat is close .
dual-us item and technolog ( debat )
that wa not the case , howev .
final , just a few key problem remain .
i think that such export should not be permit .
we must ensur that that is the case .
i now look forward to the debat .
dual-us item are not nich good .
dual-us item are product with two use .
that is incorrect .
in these committe , we have taken a veri clear posit .

there are various way to make this control difficult .
the list of destin countri is veri limit .
howev , i would like to mention two aspect .
the amend seek to make life easier for arm export .
therefor , my group will not support these amend .
other - like my countri , austria - abid by the restrict .
we must combat this imbal .
howev , the system must also be kept up-to-d .
we must rememb that trade is essenti a good thing .
most compani know exact what these product are .
i think it is import to simplifi trade .
consequ , it role should be strengthen , not overlook .
thank you again for this debat , mr presid .

that should not be the case .
this is also import .

this report help u with that .
it is a veri good report and everybodi should support it .

she still ha a littl way to go .
other problem that we have to face includ genit mutil .
i welcom this and look forward to this action plan .
this packag will be present next month .
what i say is : we have had enough .
it can not go on .
i ask all of you to say likewis .
the eu need to act now and stop this violenc .
therefor , the commiss must respond now .
violenc is not a privat matter .
on behalf of the ald group . - thank you mr presid .
for instanc , we need a minimum level of assist servic .
domest violenc is not a privat famili matter .
the problem of domest violenc is relat to this .

thank you veri much .
we need adequ resourc to tackl this kind of violenc .
it is high time to put an end to this .
thank you veri much .
after all , this is a question of ensur equal and develop .
consequ , we can not reduc fund in this area .
there is a need to look at that risk and probabl .
let u take one exampl : rape .
in malta , the rape of a man by anoth man doe not exist .
woman are at most risk within their own four wall .
the commonest caus of injuri in woman is domest violenc .
this is whi a direct is necessari .
this catalogu of measur is necessari , howev .
they must not feel guilt or shame .
my thank onc again to all member for your strong resolv .
togeth , we will succeed in this fight .
the debat is close .
the vote will take place on tuesday , 5 april 2011 .
written statement ( rule 149 )
unfortun , the amend did not go through .
that is the onli way to break the spiral of violenc .
we must rememb the victim at all time .
the help provid to victim must be genuin and guarante .
i call on the commiss to take action in this direct .
human right and gender equal are among the eu 's prioriti .
some do not have ani at all .
composit of parliament : see minut
the next item is the joint debat on :
sever measur need to be taken in the short term .
resettl need to be consid .
these measur repres the immedi answer to the situat .
i look forward to take your question .
a global phenomenon must be dealt with by a global polici .
now is the time to chang that .
stabil without democraci is not a sustain way forward .
stabil plus poverti doe not offer ani prospect .
we should not be scare of migrant .
is that not what the eu wa found for ?
whatev happen to the blue card regul ?
we are concern with the polit fact that this repres .
we do not expect much .
this is what we are ask of europ .
i believ that what you said is along those line .
these event are sure to be follow by migrat flow .
it ha alreadi start and it is sure to continu .
with solidar also come respons .
i think that this differ say it all .
where is europ ?
europ ha left itali alon to face the unpreced emerg .
it is time to stop talk .
the european union need to make it presenc felt .
the onli differ is that realiti is surpass fiction .
they can not cope alon .
we have instrument that we are not use proper .
we have four fund .
they can not cope alon .
who can cope ?
we must meet the expect of the peopl of the south .
the fear of immigr must no longer guid our polici .
it is not show solidar .
this right concern the countri that must accept them .
we are one hundr per cent with our peopl , no if or but .
these peopl must develop their own countri .
we react when thing have alreadi occur .
let u not be the man of yesterday .
let u be today 's institut .
i believ in solidar .
solidar and respons ha to be a two-way street .
( applaus )
it wa a journey into hell ; into hell , i say !
between 2009 and 2011 , noth ha chang .
it is this hypocrisi that need to be chang .
that singl sentenc contain two complet contradictori idea .
they no longer control their own foreign polici .
the european union is not respons for these fortun seeker .
let those countri take respons , not u and not now .
fine , but whi do they all have to come to europ ?
you are just allow all of that !
we can not afford that .
that is your world , but not mine .
we now call on the european council to honour it word .
we have a tool alreadi ; we just need to use it .
there is no doubt that there is a mass exodus leav libya .
sure this would qualifi a a mass influx .
a solut should have been found by now .
( de ) madam presid , i would like to address three point .
yes , we must increas frontex 's resourc at all cost .
that will be the financi express of our solidar .
take your propos and put them befor the council .
tomorrow , we will do our bit in parliament .
this even 's debat touch on these theme .
we are bound to ask ourselv certain question about this .
we can not go and oust presid who are driven by crime .
even the un can not do this .
by this i am primarili think of prevent conflict .
we can nevertheless be sure of certain thing .
first , human digniti must be respect in all human be .
i am well awar of this and i know you will act .
we hope that your propos will be follow up .
this is an opportun to build europ .
( el ) madam presid , we are at a turn point .
onli in this way can we stop and prevent futur migrat .
everi corner of this europ is europ .
i congratul mr provera .
we can not elimin it , but we must manag it .
we have fail to address the problem sinc 1990 .
it is not import who vote in the parti and how .
what is of paramount import is who count the vote .
what a disgrac !
it is time to act , commission .
first , the eu should focus on the caus of migrat flow .
second , i believ that migrant ' right need to be protect .
north africa is , of cours , face a challeng .
they are prepar for elect later this summer .
this is a challeng for which we should provid our support .
it is a challeng for european migrat polici .
believ me , mr keller , we are tri to do that .
there is a challeng face lampedusa and malta .
we have , in fact , offer assist to itali .
we have the answer : we have europol in place .
this is part of a larger mobil partnership .
most of the refuge are in tunisia and egypt .
a i said , more than 400 000 peopl have left libya .
most of these peopl have been repatri .
but there are some peopl remain .
i visit these refuge camp onli a few day ago .
they can not return home .
we need to assist these peopl .
they need to be resettl in europ .
we might see more peopl come .
mani of these peopl might be in need of intern protect .
these peopl are inde a european challeng .
they will probabl need shelter .
we have certain fund .
we have certain agenc .
we have certain polici to tri to assist these peopl .
today , that major doe not exist .
i urg member state to do this .
i will be happi to report back to you after that .
there are current 1 400 migrant on lampedusa .
this bring u to the report .
i end by say that the situat is veri difficult to sum up .
the joint debat is close .

written statement ( rule 149 )
the report on migrat ha a solut for prevent migrat flow .

but do you know how that come across to our citizen ?
what they see are inequ , a feel of injustic , insecur ' .
that is how it translat for them .
look at the bank ' profit .
look at the massiv pay packet .
peopl will say : this is total insan !
so , if we do not respond , we will not succeed .
did you think about that ?
i have not read anyth in the paper .
i have heard noth about what you said on this matter .
and final , i turn to japan .
there is no zero risk when it come to nuclear power .
the problem is noth to do with stress test one incid .
that is what ha happen in japan .
there is no such thing a nuclear safeti .
we say no ' to such a union .
we do not support such a union .
i say that is not what we need .
at the european level again .
first , let u consid econom polici .
we have alreadi heard some critic here .
my third point relat to japan .
well , the chicken have come home to roost .
( nl ) mr barroso , you will get your way .
where will that money come from ?
how is the fund to be made up ?
yet these countri do not have ani money .
the euro can not be rescu in this way .
instead , these countri should be remov from it .
i believ we are onli now face into the real test .
it ha taken u two and a half year to reach this point .
i want to see result .
that is the realiti .
there is absolut no reason to rest on one 's laurel .
i must concur with mr verhofstadt .
i certain do not agre with mr schulz .
thing like this should not be allow to happen in europ .
that is also the opinion of the portugues govern .
is this european justic ?
this is serious .

we need solut that are accept to everyon .
we need to ensur that everyon shoulder their respons .
noth is said about product or our resourc .
noth is said about energi product .
you are tell u that those on benefit should not worri .
you also tell u that revenu is be taken care of .
you talk to u about stress test .
those last year were a joke .
be serious !
anyway , they obvious have noth to worri about .
and the later we restructur , the more pain the exercis .
( applaus )
it is unjust and it is undemocrat .
ireland 's debt burden is not sustain .
we need european muscl to deal with this , too .
second , much stronger socio-econom coordin is need .
but what is the european quid pro quo ?
whi is the european budget be cut ?
i want you to mark my word .
( sv ) madam presid , let me start with someth posit .
a a finn , i regret that .
thank you veri much .
howev , you are still welcom to tri .
think that the financi crisi is over is pure fantasi .
there are two topic that are particular caus for concern .
there is no escap this .
event in greec will serv to arous emot .
the second topic is nuclear power .
there is therefor a game to be play .
the problem is the basic direct of european econom govern .
deficit are the effect and not the caus of the crisi .
we talk about strengthen european competit .
right so , but which model of competit are we pursu ?
mani privat individu felt the same way .
they bought expens hous far beyond what they could afford .
the debt crisi is be tackl with new debt .
madam presid , that will not succeed .
these economi are shrink alarm .
this is set a cours straight for bankruptci .
it is therefor time for crisi strategi 2.0 .
the situat could then be re-examin in a year or 10 .
the council suggest reduc the regulatori burden .
well done !
the first level be between the member state themselv .
this is fine if it is a one-off .
let u look at what happen yesterday in the irish elect .
let u look at the elector debat today in portug .
infinit much more is at stake .
( applaus )
my question then is : where are the cut to be made ?
romano prodi onc famous said that these draft are stupid .
the war in libya goe on .
you are consist .
for that reason i have foregon the photograph .
when i saw you , therefor , i felt let down .
europ must stand on the side of freedom .
you have defin it yourselv : the eu 2020 strategi .
we need public invest , first and foremost in educ .
did you penalis them for do that ?
this is not the european union we want .
these are the new talk shop .
perhap we will suggest it .
that is not the case .
we must ensur that there is open and transpar .
it must be updat .
but is this all talk ?
it is time to walk the walk .
they call on u to choos growth .
i certain do .
extrem posit are be adopt .
they turn up unexpect , both insid and outsid the eu .
it is primarili a conserv success .
it implement depend on uniti .
whoever stay out miss out .
you are mistaken !
it is imper that we improv the world 's nuclear safeti .
we wish you everi success in this .
it is sad , but true .
creat the singl currenc ha undoubt been a success .
howev , it look like a beauti hous with a damag roof .
what el can we do for our close southern neighbour ?
no one can be against that .
thank you in advanc for your answer .
what ha japan taught u ?
what are we do ?
we are accus japan of neglig .
this mean that we did not learn our lesson from japan .
madam presid , i would like to touch upon three issu .
my second remark concern neighbourhood polici .
we seem to be redesign our neighbourhood polici .
my third point concern eu-nato .
at the same time , this relationship is import .
let u aim to be success this time .
that goal is to secur stabl growth .
what will low or littl govern debt ensur ?
when busi develop , invest will follow .
it is therefor possibl .
thank you for your attent .
it is excel have such a mechan .
in my countri , peopl have two concern .
first , they do not know how mani peopl will come .
what we should do is use it .
first , that there is no major in the council of minist .
i appeal to presid barroso not to cite this a reason .
howev , we should be care .
the central issu remain enhanc competit .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
it is good that an agreement ha been reach .
but is protect enough on it own ?
is it not necessari to go further ?
this is someth which we need to consid .
plea answer this question for me .
i have a question about each .
whatev doe this mean ?
it could onli mean one thing .
when will we final see a tax on financi transact ?
it is a shame that hungari ha miss out on this .
( de ) madam presid , the eu is a master of procrastin .
i again appeal to everyon to observ the relev criterion .
natur is a stronger forc than man can har .
it is time to put an end to nuclear power .
so , let u final concentr on the renew energi .
therefor , let u be intellectu honest in our ass .
substanc is more import than instrument .
this wa reject by our member state .
we present the text at the euro area summit .
it wa reject by a larg major of member state .
that is the realiti .
howev , it wa reject .
this wa reject by some of our member state .
this may be an opportun for u to work even more close .
that is all on the issu of ambit at european level .
( applaus )
it wa not easi , howev .
there are poverty-rel problem in europ .
that is the situat .
let u be absolut clear .
and we have to fight for that .
at the same time , let u be absolut clear on this a well .
govern are also part respons .
that respons is essenti .
this wa reject by a huge number of our g20 partner .
let u be honest , onc again .
sever member state fundament oppos it .
they will not agre .
i think this is basic in term of fair .
i will come forward with propos on this matter .
the same goe for the ccctb .
this is exact the approach we are defend .
the challeng we need to resolv is our econom renew .
let u not confus caus and effect .
( applaus )
( applaus )
this is probabl becaus it is not so bad after all .
my second observ concern methodolog , if you will .
and europ is bring addit pressur to bear .
are our govern measur too weak ?
a i have alreadi said , the past need to be manag .
so there is the futur and there is the past .
we need to be self-crit there .
could we have taken those measur a year ago ?
have there been major error in the past ?
should we do more ?
of cours we should .
are public invest the onli instrument ?
not at all !
the intern market , the singl market is extrem import .
it must be develop further .
without europ , there would have been massacr .
some of you have been veri critic of the european union .
yet we act in time !
did we get thing wrong in the past ?
did we adopt the right polici ?
did we correct our mistak ?
and the european union deserv credit for correct them .
( applaus )
i should like to say one last thing in my own languag .
i , too , feel let down by so much intellectu dishonesti .
i want to be veri clear on this .
( applaus )
i would ask you to plea stop hide behind the council .
this wa not what the treati of lisbon wa about .
you are misinterpret the treati of lisbon .
( applaus )
( applaus )
the debat is close .
written statement ( rule 149 )
of cours , the work in this respect must not stop .

we must take even bolder decis .

question hour with the presid of the commiss
mr oetting , it is nice to see you .
i found this veri interest .
we are go to do this for all the nuclear site in europ .
we are go to do this in full transpar .
it is import to acknowledg that fact .
i believ this is progress in term of nuclear safeti .
so whi not interven straight away ?
i believ that this is a real and present danger .
this is a nation compet .
this is the case in all member state , includ hungari .
hungari did that befor the access to the union .
there are even countri that have done this after access .
it is import for the commiss to look into this .
this is a matter that should not even have to be discus .
but we are do that to make the live of our citizen better .
whi should this be ?
whi have we set such high limit ?
mr harm , you have rais a veri import issu .
these will then enter into forc a of next week .
i can not take decis sole on the basi of person opinion .
we have a regul that wa establish after chernobyl .
it wa base on the best scientif evid .
it ha a differ threshold to the one we have in europ .
we are go to implement this for japan .
this is undoubt a sourc of growth for the european union .
howev , you know the institut you are run .
the commiss ha a good record on this matter .
for this reason i intend to focus on a particular aspect .
my question relat to euratom .
after all , nuclear power doe not respect nation border .
that is precis where the problem lie .
let me say that we are on target to achiev that goal .
are member state readi to go forward ?
on behalf of the efd group . - mr barroso , i am confus .
what is the eu 's polici on libya ?
yet she wrote this mani day after the bomb had begun .
that is what she ha been say .
that wa probabl what ladi ashton wa refer to .
we have to recognis this .
she is a veri commit european .
she ha a veri difficult and challeng job .
we have mani colleagu on the list .
plea rais a white card - or ani other .
the blue card is for quit a differ procedur .
we have to act within our sphere of respons .
if so , how do you propos do this ?
i can assur you that japan veri much appreci that gestur .
what measur could it take ?
that is my question .
this issu is one we all need to get behind .
( fr ) mr presid , first of all someth posit , mr barroso .
my second point concern import of food product from japan .
there is a fundament issu here .
i am sure you have child .
last , i have an appeal to make to you mr barroso .
colleagu , you are talk in the place of other member .
there is a long list of colleagu who are wait to speak .
a regard this last point , i wa not awar of this situat .
concern the issu of milk , you are right mr rivasi .
tepco 's stock of anti-radi suit ran out veri quick .
he and his colleagu were forc to invent spare part .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
i think that what you have said is extrem import .
and let me tell you about the japanes peopl too .
that is what the scientist are tell u .
that is what common sen tell u .
what doe the commiss have to say to all this ?
we are serious about this .
i believ that special attent should be paid to this .
but what is happen at eu level ?
we will do that public with full transpar .
this is what is caus confus .
i wonder if you could throw some light on this .
whi are there two differ regul ?
for the japanes economi it also repres veri littl .
a i mention , japan ha veri high food safeti standard .
that conclud the item .
so the measur in place so far are not adequ .
i would like to make three key point here .
these are a follow .
a a minimum , all rom child should complet primari school .
third , the union must put it money where it mouth is .
what is next ?
the council will deal with it in a horizont manner .
the reason for this is that 8 april is intern rom day .
neither is collect label permiss .
i would like to make some critic of the present framework .
it is now essenti to ensur that they are fulfil .
primari school attend is mandatori in all countri .
the situat , a we can see , is fair complic .
i believ the agenc ha proven it compet in this area .
i find this a weak in the communic .
i find this anoth weak in the commiss document .
it is good that it is mention in this communic .
i feel this would have been a plus in this communic .
this is what wa agre .
there are no structur for the specif implement of target .
there is no gender perspect .
i think so .
she sold her own littl girl .
other send them to do other thing .
do we want to talk about these problem a well ?
the debat is close .
written statement ( rule 149 )
if a firm stanc is not taken , the situat will deterior .
howev , these ambit still need to be put into practic .
intern rom day will be celebr next friday , 8 april .
in this way , we will also make addit save dure implement .
whi youth ?
reduc the increas to 2.3 % is therefor progress .
it is in fact a cut of about 0.5 % in real term .
howev , we should recognis that save have been made .
final , could i also rais two import outstand issu ?
it is far too soon for u to commit ourselv to that .
it need to be dealt with in other report .
we can not let ourselv be divert from other import topic .
i believ that we can expect a fruit cooper with all group .
we realli should be honest enough to call a spade a spade .
this would save quit a consider amount .
howev , this is part of the commiss budget .
is that what we realli want ?
is this the signal this hous want to give to our citizen ?
no , this is the wrong decis .
that would be the right thing to do from a polit perspect .
the best exampl of that happen this morn .
noth could be further from the truth .
both impli the absorpt of a huge loss .
there are mani way to save money for the european taxpay .
use the tram .
it will be a museum anyway .
there is huge scope for save on energi cost .
we wast a tremend amount of energi everi year .
there is larg scope for save on secur and it servic .
we should review and revis our health insur cost a well .
budget is about set prioriti , both posit and negat .
we also decid about money for employ peopl .
the same criterion appli to our salari and expens .
the answer is not much , but still enough .
this report provid no vision .
this is too crazi for word !
we must now start to take this matter serious .
i think that we should do more .
we must start work on this review .
it is perhap time that someon did .
i am plea about that .
madam presid , i have a question for my honour colleagu .
howev , that is not take respons ; that is popul .
i do not think i need to go on .
madam presid , mr porta doe not need to continu .
basic i agre with him .
i also want to go further .
i am not happi that we end up with an increas of 2.3 % .
at that time , the will to review certain thing wa lack .
that is probabl the most sensibl way to approach this .
it may well be that i will then be among them .
it is better to reflect care on where we can make cut .
let u do so , then , a a matter of prioriti .
i now turn to u , the member of this hous .
is it not time to review this financi statut ?
nonetheless , cost-effici is the golden rule .
there is no doubt about that .
i would welcom an opportun to examin the evid .
doe this project make sen ?
should a parliament oper a museum ?
no , definit not .
i am therefor not in favour of this budget increas .
doe this or doe this not all have to be paid for ?
youth is never a controversi area : youth is a necess .
for exampl , my countri ha 50 % youth unemploy .
i am sure that is the prioriti for all of you .
i think that we could look for more save here .
we are veri frequent travel .
thank you veri much .
that is the onli solut .
parliament ha new power .
one more word on the issu of youth .
the commiss 's current propos for updat salari is 0.9 % .
parliament alon can not amend the statut for member .
the approv of the commiss and the council are requir .
regul ( ec ) no 31 could also be amend , specif articl 64 .
the debat is close .
the situat is improv .
thank you for your attent .
we expect that to chang in the report for the follow year .
the third issu concern the transpar of beneficiari ' fund .
howev , we need to improv this great .
we need one-stop transpar .
it provid u with an insight into what may be go wrong .
it provid u with an insight into what can be improv .
in that context , this report is veri import inde .
first of all , the report need to be more precis .
second , the member state need to improv their report .
itali is a problem child in this regard .
this will yield u eur 500 million .
this is realli a veri import point .
well , this is intoler .
thank you veri much for your attent .
commission , i wa not at all plea to read this .
this system need further improv .
this is also evid in the report .
henc our call for the full implement of the im .
we are veri unhappi with the situat in itali .
we are fight corrupt .
these are the basic tool we should use to fight corrupt .
( nl ) madam presid , i am plea with this report .
larg amount of eu fund are wrong spent .
these were just a few fact from the report .
( nl ) madam presid , i thank mr stae for his question .
let me be clear - i am a great advoc of this .
second , the clariti of regul .
itali ha often been discus in relat to this subject .
itali is also mention in mr ivan 's document .
defraud must be punish .
for irregular a differ method must be appli .
there is a veri distinct differ .
huge improv have been made in this area .
that is someth that we need to be awar of .
let u not terroris the individu .
the current recoveri rate is veri low and intoler .
the commiss must recov this money immedi .
the issu wa rais of transpar of beneficiari a well .
the debat is close .

the commission paint a rather depress pictur .

subject : propos ban on shark fin
in general there is a ban on shark fin .

madam presid , cut the fin off shark is barbar .
it is inhuman ; it is barbar .
dump back into the sea , they die .
it is a practic that should be ban .
i appreci that it is veri difficult .
how do you polic it ?
we need to put in place a regul ban this practic complet .
the figur speak for themselv .
it is a veri lucrat busi inde .
we need to ban it complet .
we should take the lead in that regard .

i would like to make one more comment .
that is abund clear .
the intern market repres a huge opportun for all of u .
in addit , busi need more fund to develop innov .
growth , develop and social awar must go hand in hand .
there must be econom growth at the servic of citizen .
i would like to draw attent to four import aspect .

you may consid it want , other may consid it complet .
but here end the debat .
( nl ) mr presid , let me begin with the posit .
take , for exampl , voic and data roam charg .
one danger lie in the inequ of eu citizen .
one of the cornerston of the singl market is the euro .
the euro simplifi trade across border .
we would have more job and more prosper .
the first aspect concern competit .
social right must never be seen a obstacl .
no one ha mention the idea of a new value-ad tax strategi .
there are posit and negat aspect to all three report .
the list consist of four key point .
you need our help .
so do not let u down and give them the confid they need !
there is still much to do to deliv this .
commission barnier , do not let this throw you .
just one word to my fellow member , mr sinclair .
mr correia de campo is concern about movement of worker .
well , so am i .
the eu ha swamp the unit kingdom with extra worker .
the unit kingdom see the world a the market .
small busi is the victim here .
it is not a pipe dream ; it is realist and also modern .
in today 's text , we have this .
it expans and success is crucial for our economi .
i would ask the commission to be bold .
all of this form part of modern public procur law .
europ is finger a be respons for the crisi .
this must stop .
europ is frequent hard to comprehend .
it should becom easi to comprehend .
europ must embodi a constant strive for simplif .
europ must continu to harmonis .
last , europ is often seen to be a sourc of constraint .
it should henceforth be seen a a sourc of enabl .
parliament , i am sure , will support you in this matter .
that is not a good thing for busi or for their employe .
plea come to grip with this subject a well .
it is now up to you to turn them into a legisl propos .
for this reason , the social claus is import .
we now come to the catch-the-ey procedur .
howev , i will tri to divid that time fair and even .
thank you , mr presid .
final , on public procur , i welcom the commiss 's propos .

we must improv the govern of the intern market .
mr løkkegard and mr grech also mention communic .
it is go much faster than u in certain area .

for me , this is extrem import from two aspect .
the commiss ha alreadi complet a good part of the job .
natur , howev , they , too , still have much to do .
this is the hungarian presid 's motto a well .
we intend to adopt conclus on the subject a well .
the other such topic is the digit agenda .
last , i would like to address social aspect .
it is our common interest to protect this .
we must also be realist .
final , mobil ha also been mention frequent .
we must rais the polit profil of the singl market .
we need to take action immedi and not after some year .

there is a propos for a moratorium .
both of these thing are possibl .
in this parliament , we condemn crime against human .
that energi ha alway come from a varieti of sourc .
it express what unit u , not what divid u .
that is our respons for tomorrow .
howev , secur also involv human resourc .
we must guarante optimum work condit .
it is not just about earthquak .
these are the onli one that are complet safe .
we will have to concentr and think care .
the tepco compani ha behav irrespons .
we need to go much further than we have in the past .
we want more renew energi and more energi effici .
we no longer want to use fossil fuel .
we want job in trade and industri .
it is also a potenti danger form of energi .
we must be fulli awar of this .
i think that we are all awar of that .
how should we do this ?
claud mention 15 year .
we have to be awar of this .
peopl alway learn from everi disast .
peopl do not stop fli after major air disast .
reliabl and safeti are improv .
politician must refrain from quick and simpl judgment .
we can perhap postpon them until the week after next .
parliament ha no contribut to make to this debat .
parliament will be exclud from the process .
you know that we have total oppos posit on this subject .
that is true and you are absolut right .
this is all that i am ask for , no more and no le .
can i not have equal treatment ?
the sweater that i am wear today is 30 year old .
in those day , we were demonstr against nuclear power .
first chernobyl , then fukushima .
where next ?
have you chang your posit on this point ?
is it so bad not to chang your view about someth ?
that is a major chang in comparison to my previous view .
you may see that a be satisfactori or a unsatisfactori .
i stand by what i have said .
it would be good if we could adopt this resolut unanim .
we all agre on that .
( applaus )
how should we look to the futur ?
thank you for your attent .
the unthink ha happen .
there is no such thing a zero risk .
today , we need to take three step .
ani nuclear plant which is not safe should be close down .
we must ask what guarante can be given of their safeti ?
( the presid interrupt the speaker )
both these altern have their difficulti .
with coal , it is co2 emiss .
there ha been a lack of clear and transpar communic .
howev , there were six nuclear plant , not one .
how mani would be enough for her to chang her opinion ?
that is my answer to the first question .
may i continu ?
how mani accid will it take to chang my mind ?
we know that there are a number of plant in japan .
we have to learn someth from each such incid .
there is one more question i have not answer .
there were three question .
the krško nuclear power plant .
the consequ are too long-last .
( applaus )
the stress test propos by the commiss are necessari .
the test must be carri out with the commiss 's involv .
the test ' result must be use when revis the direct .
the consequ of the test must be veri clear .
those which pas continu to oper , those which fail stop .
the onli drawback is that they will not be compulsori .
anoth fail is that the eu ha not drawn up common standard .
it is imper , howev , that these should exist .
third , an independ bodi should carri out these test .
i have a question to put to our commission , mr oetting .
it is about the implement of these stress test .
natur is stronger and more power than mankind .
we need stress test , mr oetting !
we do not want a second chernobyl .
we need limit for food from japan .
i have one question for the commiss .
do you realli want to irradi the peopl of europ ?
we must invest in and make use of altern energi .
they do exist .
they are safe , environment friend and le harm to peopl .
one more point : they creat new job .
now it is a solar power station .
mr presid , this debat should be about nuclear safeti .
what follow-up will there be on those safeti ass ?
we need to look at the safeti of plant now .
let u move to anoth stage of look at the energi mix .
let u be honest : renew are not an easi answer either .
we have been systemat condemn japan .
whi is this ?
a total of 35 % renew energi in nine year !
in poland , 90 % of electr is current generat use coal .
nineti per cent !
i do not think that they will .
( applaus and heckl )
i am speak a a european .

the debat is close .
the vote will take place tomorrow at noon .
written statement ( rule 149 )
sellafield is the most famous .
stress test on nuclear facil repres a step forward .
we are talk about more than 400 nuclear reactor worldwid .
i welcom the introduct of stress test ' a soon a possibl .
there is no safe way .
there will alway be accid .
howev , these measur should be target in the right direct .
at the moment , safeti is our top prioriti .
yes , we must phase out nuclear power - that is clear .
howev , it is imposs to do this overnight .
that is whi we must act on two level .

order of busi
the follow amend have been propos :
[ wednesday ] :
mr speroni will now present the amend .
thank you .
rather , it is proof of the complex situat in egypt .
we have to be sensibl , though .
six point are go to be discus with baro ashton .
it realli doe not make sen .
we need a proper debat on what is happen in egypt .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
that is not a point of order .
that is an item on the order of busi a far a i am awar .
whi is this veri import to u ?
i apologis for have mix up tuesday and wednesday .
mr cohn-bendit , thank you for your remark .
i will check it .
a special gestur !
i declar the order of busi for the week adopt .
the next item is the debat on :
small-scal fish , in particular , is sever affect .
fisherman 's incom are also depend on the price of oil .
i am call for a littl more flexibl for the member state .
this is not just about econom profit .
cheap altern , le tasti too , but that is besid the point .
what a regrett situat !
the duty-fre import of plaic fillet must stop , mr presid .
ladi and gentleman , we urgent need concret measur .
this crisi demand that europ take decis action .
i call on you to vote for such action .
of cours , we work in brussel .
we therefor call on the commiss to look into this .
yet , whi is the incom of our fisherman decreas ?
a far a i can see , there are three reason for this .
we politician need to step in here .
we must do what we can to help .
i would stress that we can onli do what we can .
we have not use those possibl .
this will lead to more abund fish stock in the mid-term .
mani member state are now forc to implement auster measur .
this is the most import reason of all .
that is whi we urg the member state to use our fund .
this is , in fact , a collect respons .
all of u are suffer becaus fuel price have gone up .
let u subsidis each other !
this is all nonsens .
they do not actual know what it mean .
it is becaus of the unsustain fish practic of decad .
this is a question of polit logic .
so we have a vicious circl .
in 2007 , de minimi measur were adopt .
the era of cheap crude oil ha gone .
this is a fact .
the de minimi principl is intend to appli until 2013 .
whi is this import ?
nobodi ha suggest increas fish effort .
this is whi i think it is a huge mistak .
yet we must do the exact opposit .
but is this problem caus by the increas in fuel price ?
are you sure about that ?
of cours , now we are discus fuel price .
this is a problem and we must discus how we can face it .
let u look at this problem .
what is this ceil ?
let me put it clear so that we understand the situat .
the member state can give their own state aid .
the richer member state can alreadi give it now .
regard the fund , let me explain .
the member state use onli 20 % of our fund .
onli itali ha ask u for a realloc and we approv it .
we have to understand this .
the debat is close .
radio spectrum polici ( debat )
for me , the choic is simpl .
here we have the propos .
what wa right mention is that this is a moment of choic .
we are all awar that broadcast know no border .
no doubt about that , we are complet on your side .
just a coupl of remark to conclud .
a clear statement is need , the sooner the better .
time is run out .
i hope that we will succeed in do so in futur , too .
everyon seem to agre on this point .
they need to be qualit , not just quantit , solut .
i believ that this econom dimens is essenti .
but let u face it : it will not come easili .
that is whi we have introduc rule on competition-proof .
this is cutting-edg technolog , and it is veri import .
it is an asset of which no one can claim exclus ownership .
first , the principl of medium plural .
this point also deserv close attent .
let me tell you , those advantag of scale are clock up .
everi year , they can make a differ of eur 80 billion .
good luck with it !
mr hökmark ha found a good compromis here .
this perform level must be defin .
at home , one gigabyt cost me eur 1 .
we urgent need to take action in this regard .
we have urgent prioriti to address in this regard .
broadband technolog is undoubt an import part of this .
a coordin role would certain be desir , howev .
there are still hurdl to be overcom , no doubt about that .
spectrum is a nation compet : i am awar of that .
howev , we need to be abl to take decis .
the debat is close .
the vote will take place on wednesday , 11 may 2011 .
emerg autonom trade prefer for pakistan ( debat )
the number of product select is limit .
i therefor hope that parliament will support the propos .
i think that would be veri problemat .
the outcom of these consult is current uncertain .
i want to highlight two of these point here .
i believ that we have a differ of opinion on this point .
howev , what is the situat in pakistan at the moment ?
we , i am proud to say , react fast .
one thing wa absolut clear .
we need to think outsid the box .
we need to come up with a new solut to provid help .
at wto level , object have been regist to our eu propos .
there should not be a link .
that is the right approach .
there is a contradict in it approach .
i ask them to reconsid .
i believ this hous should reaffirm the commiss posit .
we have the guarante of annual impact ass .
the credibl of the eu is at stake .
give the commiss propos your support .
i did so at the time and i do now .
no altern solut ha been present , howev .
it is no wonder that this countri is now put up resist .
we think it is necessari to help pakistan .
today , the justif is humanitarian aid to pakistan .
yesterday , it wa help in the fight against terror .
we have seen noth like that from the commiss .
i sincer hope that the regul will be reject dure the vote .
i doubt it .
whi specif on textil ?
we would be equal use to the flood victim in pakistan .
thus , this sector is not realli affect at all .
that would be the right approach to take .
the propos for eu trade prefer ha no specif aim .
let u ask whi we need this packag .
unfortun , our respons ha been veri curmudgeon .
humanitarian aid should be disburs without polit string .
howev , allow me also to bring in a humanitarian aspect .
ha this chang ?
we have been ask : whi textil from pakistan ?
the answer is : becaus textil are a major export for them .
i would simpli like to stress a coupl of point .
first , we are not discus an fta .
second , we are not discus the gsp either .
i do not think i have to name them .
we tri to find a solut .
we can onli tri to do our best to get it through .
it is partial , yes .
allow me just two final observ .

free trade agreement with india ( debat )
the issu is simpl .
there is no need to stress the import of this initi .
india is clear interest at the highest polit level .
we have made progress across a rang of issu .
a with ani negoti , the last yard are the most difficult .
this make negoti veri challeng .
howev , we must remain realist .
we are not pursu sanction but cooper in this area .
but let me reassur you on these crucial point .
negoti have so far proven to be difficult .
if the substanc is not there , we should simpli say no .
everyon understand the import of develop trade between u .
i should like to emphasis a few point in particular .
i am think of the provis on seed , for exampl .
first : access to medicin .
second : industri sector .
third : agricultur .
the commission mention , quit right , sustain develop .
i would say to you that we have to be veri care .
i would also agre with mr caspari on time limit .
i think he put a veri good point forward there .
what effect will this have on the eu-india fta ?
india 's per caput gdp is about 6 % of that of the eu .
we must not forget this .
exampl have alreadi been mention .
how come ?
trade relat play a huge role , today .
it is in our interest .
more than 800 million peopl live on le than usd 2 a day .
of cours they want to elimin child labour .
i call this the trader 's take on thing ' .
this way of think pervad the resolut that is befor u .
i call that the preacher 's take on thing ' .
in my opinion , the resolut befor u is a retrograd step .
the dalit have hard been mention at all .
i can not therefor endors the text of the resolut .
our negoti have to hold on to the 2009 resolut .
i wonder if you could provid u with those today ?
the world order is chang .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
the first is fair for our produc and for our industri .
that ha been mention sever time alreadi .
that is also extrem import .

that is the best way we can help .
that is what this is about , noth el .

second , we wish to rais the issu of non-tariff barrier .

you have list clear criterion for when you will do that .
i advoc that we continu along this path .
we are a legisl bodi ; we draft a budget .

this realli can not continu .
they should serv a a basi for essenti improv secur .
this incur far more expenditur .
that is whi we need to rais the matter and talk about it .
they will continu to be enforc in futur .
ladi and gentleman , i would like to highlight two report .

we follow a similar procedur last year and the year befor .
these are the problem which should be overcom at last .
congratul , we realli appreci that .
i would like to make five comment .
second , quantiti is one thing , qualiti is anoth .
third , allow me to comment on financi manag .
i think that we need to take that on board .
there are inde far too mani non-quantifi error .
someth realli need to happen on that front .
my fifth and last comment concern the invest facil .
that is actual not accept .
we need to remedi a few thing .
there is a lot we can learn from that .
we are ask for better coordin of fund .
i would like to thank them all for that .
nevertheless cepol need to step up it effort .
let me now conclud with a horizont report .
i am veri satisfi with the readi of the court to do so .
minist , thank you veri much for come here this morn .
i therefor invit parliament to begin discus on this issu .
we are readi to share our idea with you .
the 2009 discharg procedur is now reach it end .
you have heard the court of auditor and examin it report .
i would like to focus on three topic of special interest .
they are the closest to the project which we are discus .
my group fulli endors his conclus .
how can we ensur improv of the manag of implement organis ?
the edf should also contribut to that .
it ha two instrument , two mandat in fact , for do so .
moreov , the commiss ha a heavi respons in this matter .
we will have to ensur that this acqui is preserv .
this rate decreas from 54 % in 2007 to 36 % .
we think that more effort must be made in this field .
i think that is go too far , to put it polit .
it should plea stop do so .
in this area onli 73 % of the fund have been commit .
it wa said to be a measur to promot tourism .
ladi and gentleman , we still have a lot to do here .
this should not be left to each individu countri .
even so , it is essenti to continu make progress with it .
the error are not increas .
this is also where we have the biggest problem .
this show that it is possibl .
we need clear rule .
this is anoth area in which the commiss must make improv .
i would like to thank mr chatzimarkaki .
i will tri to carri on your work well dure the next year .
now we are make progress .
this is not fair .
nonetheless , thank you for be here .
whi then do we not have the same at european level ?
everi one of these propos is excel .
first of all , the commiss .
i also have to thank the commiss .
this is my 12th discharg exercis .
i agre to a larg extent with what mr gerbrandi ha said .
for me , that is a vital import demand .
there is also a need for better control .
i have to offer explicit thank to mr well .
i wa the discharg rapporteur for the last exercis .
howev , let me add a side comment on that point .
we want an open debat about the council 's budget .
we have problem there .
no , we are not be over critic .
it should be commend for this .
we would like to see it .
this is becaus it doe not exist .
today we are debat the eu 's account for 2009 .
it made shock read .
this should ring alarm bell ahead of the vote .
medicin agenc and cepol postpon is piecem .
there can be no doubt that reform is need here .
that is not suffici for this discharg procedur .
corrigenda ( rule 216 ) : see minut
2009 discharg ( continu of debat )
one of our concern is institut transpar .
the differ wa eur 112 billion over a seven-year period .
parliament agre to revis their figur to eur 110 billion .
that is what the council sign up to .
that is a good omen for the upcom negoti .
final , i would like to touch on a general matter .
it is time we had a posit da for a chang .
there is simpli too much money float around .
a signific portion of it is be inappropri spent .
those are the conclus of the court of auditor .
the same is true of the european parliament 's budget .
we have too much money .
good luck with this , madam presid .
a great mani member have taken part in the debat .
second , on the subject of develop aid .
i have a few comment .
this is link to the complex of these rule .
much ha also been spoken of increas the risk of error .
i have been work to achiev this for some time .
consequ , your offer is not realli an offer .
it is an offer to make u small and weak .
how would the nation parliament react to such a suggest ?
the critic of the regul is justifi , howev .
they are no longer justifi today .
what we are talk about here is creat new job vacanc .
the current 6.7 % of the budget is far too low an estim .
i still have a number of concern , howev .
first , the procedur for recov misspent fund is too slow .
the blame here lie with the member state .
i total agre with him on that .
that situat ha to chang .
on the council discharg , i would support postpon .
unfortun , some seem reluct to do so .
the issu of parliament 's expenditur also interest me .
it give a veri poor impress of our institut .
the principl of trust in the institut should prevail .
the error rate ha reduc notic .
i would therefor like to address you direct , mr becsey .
it work the same way in all democrat state .
it is not help to continu with these problem .
i know there are propos concern this .
i am look forward to our futur cooper .
plea would you pas this messag on to them onc again .
i consid it onli right that you are here .
i do not think there is particular caus to mention it .
nonetheless , it is good that you are here .
we veri much appreci that .
our discharg is base main on your contribut .

( applaus )
that can not be what my job is about .
in relat to schengen , i want to say one thing .
this is not a case of complet kill off the idea .
it is a case of stick to the idea and appli it univers .
it can not be .
we can not complain of a lack of fund in this area .
you attack them today a xenophob .
is that not a dread thing ?
the power of the ballot box .
well , here it is , mr barroso .

mr presid , the speaker talk of strengthen schengen .
mr presid , i thank the member for his question .
onc you fulfil those condit , then you can join schengen .
i have onli one request .
( fr ) mr presid , this debat beggar belief .
what nonsens !
when will europ stop say one thing and do anoth ?
is it not time that it open it eye ?
i for one think it is .
( applaus )
the evil of migrat continu it insidi spread .
instead , she give u some claptrap about solidar .
europ is the master .
member state want those power back .
what is the commiss go to do about this ?

howev , i am concern , commission .

unblock it .
and final , the commiss is look ahead to a migrat polici .
work with u .
yet that notion ha taken hold .
it is a citizen ' right that you can not simpli relativis .
do you want to know what honest annoy me ?
we hear a lot said about solidar .
we need to show these peopl a bit of respect .
that is what we should fight for .
that is our real task .
howev , this trust is base on reciproc oblig .
this acqui is not static , but must instead be develop .
madam presid , we must continu to take this into account .
which of these is it ?
those are the real issu !
the problem is that this communic onli goe halfway .
go on then , i dare you !
( applaus )
the answer , howev , is greater involv of eu mechan .
this is noth to do with popul , nor is it to do with fear .
there is none of that here .
is it possibl to talk about that ?
we can not say ambigu thing .
schengen is a huge achiev .
schengen must never be brought into question .
what we do not need , then , is a debat on schengen .
yet , we are here today , precis becaus it ha not done so .
this must remain our primari goal .
this challeng today is the surg of migrat and refuge .
pardon me .
howev , caution is advis .
whi is there noth more explicit here on burden-shar ?
this put the entir schengen system at risk .
temporari control are not enough .
let u refrain from creat unnecessari obstacl between u .
i would like to draw your attent to anoth problem .
what is the reason for this ?
it is a fear of peopl from romania and bulgaria .
this is scandal .
let u not open a pandora 's box by revis schengen .
let u not go back on our principl .
the possibl of introduc border control alreadi exist .
it should be temporari , except and a last resort .
short-term procedur that hinder resettl have to be remov .
do you want to subject them to border check ?
ten of million of european will travel this summer .
do you want to subject them to border check ?

the under caus are both polit and econom .
the next item is the joint debat on
the right tool for the job is crimin law .
the transpar regist ha a more modest task .

the regist is public .
i hope that the vote is near unanim .
i especi welcom the report by mr carlo casini .
the question wa whether they should regist .
a final word on the interinstitut dimens .
i would like to address two point .
the first is that the regist is not realli mandatori .
this need to be state open at this point .
madam presid , i think this would be an experi .
the more transpar and the more open there is the better .
it is disappoint that the council ha not sign up .
we also favour regular check by a common secretariat .
( da ) thank you for your question .
we do not believ that we have alreadi achiev it .
we believ that there is still someth lack .
madam presid , so we are to have a transpar regist !
i do not want ani british mep to be here anyway .
this regist is a step toward transpar , but just a step .
this work better than anyth we have here .
we are the onli bodi direct elect by them .
i hope that the other institut will follow suit .

the question is whether these measur are enough .
mani of u have been fight for this for a long time .

thank you .
you could not say it more succinct .
we must decid togeth .
our work must therefor be proactiv in natur .
while this is a serious matter , these are recent develop .
they are isol case , and a good job too .
this regist is therefor a step in the right direct .
howev , further step must be taken .
it should be anyth but rigid .
these cost should be document in a transpar manner .
we should give serious consider to other step and solut .
thank you .
here i am also refer to member state capit .
transpar ha alway been a veri import issu for the council .
this is not true .
it unjust encourag distrust of europ .
the agreement had been reach long beforehand .
the text ha , howev , remain the unchang .
that is the first clarif .
the second concern the question of oblig .
the regist is alreadi mandatori .
those who want to lobbi must enrol themselv in the regist .

this is inde essenti for the credibl of the exercis .
we ought to avoid the same error of concept and implement .

i agre with you about the support and the issu of debt .
i agre about the terribl violenc in syria .
what we have got is again a journey on sanction .
i do not think we are short-chang .
the institut of europ are all focus in the same direct .
i have to find the resourc for open an offic in benghazi .
i am also keen to improv the dialogu that we have .
mr gualtieri , you and i had a good discus yesterday .
we are hope for specif action in this area .
final , i would like to mention eu-nato relat .
these opportun need to be seiz !
so what is our current polici on syria and the middl east ?
a i have said , it is unsatisfactori .
this need to be explain to u better , baro ashton .
one more thing .
can you realli see syria chair the un human right council ?
baro ashton , sanction are not enough .
have you push for an intern inquiri into the massacr ?
it is this ambigu that weigh u down .
are we to repeat the mistak of 2007 ?
a we know , the situat is certain veri complic .
howev , i think we need to grasp this opportun .
hama ha support the arab peac initi .
both parti have made incred concess to form this govern .
that would be unthink for u .
baro ashton , the matter is urgent .
let u take the exampl of libya .
the need for unanim is paralys u .
it no longer work with 27 member state .
what can you do ?
on syria , for exampl , what are you convinc of ?
should assad be includ or not ?
what is your opinion ?
we would like to hear that .
do you want to threaten sanction or not ?
open the debat .
you are the rotat presid .
you are vice-presid of the commiss .
you can take initi .
you should set the agenda .
i do not understand whi .
be the agent of chang that we need .
that will be a moment of glori for the european union .
this is not what is meant by credibl , in my opinion .
what is happen now in tunisia ?
there is also no protect power which could bring him down .
this mean be readi to face global challeng .
we should start by address global govern gap .
the report show where the effort should be intensifi .
all this will not happen automat .
this sunday , there were local elect in albania .
how good can we be in our home field ?
we must definit make that clear .
( applaus )
that is extrem import .
turkey also play a major role in this respect .
second , partnership with russia is a veri import factor .
this is someth which we are sometim lack in .
while russia ha too much , we have too littl .
we want to buy energi from these countri .
howev , we are not realli becom suffici involv .
i believ that this is import .
what you have said today is absolut right .
is it mr westerwell or who ?
i think that will get support for you .
explor your mandat .
go ahead and tell u .
she talk about a common eu polici on foreign affair , etc .
doe that impli accept that the death penalti is a punish ?
howev , that is not meant to be a critic of her .
what she is say that mr barroso state wa not hypocrisi .
it wa a statement that wa made .
there is not one common polici , is there ?
you have an imposs task .
you said that repeat to the hous of lord .
you can draw your own conclus .
this voic , through you , speak clear .
one long-term stage ha alreadi been larg outlin .
there are rare occas when one need to speak up immedi .
this wa one of them .
let me now turn to the middl east .
we must also incorpor them into our region polici concept .
this appli , in particular , to the horn of africa .
the european defenc agenc ha idea on this subject .
howev , the world ha move on and we need a public debat .
thus , chao rule everywher , and everyon is confus .
onc it ha been establish , it should work and be effect .
it is our job and also your job to achiev this .
earlier , you agre with mr gualtieri about pool and share .
those are the three thing that we should have .
what progress is be made in ukrain ?
there are sign that this will be the case .
how should we deal with presid assad ?
this will onli be possibl with convinc leadership .
member state have a right to their own foreign polici .
anoth bloodi attack could take place at ani moment .
it is not .
the libyan no-fli zone illustr the differ .
what is your today ?
baro ashton , 17 may is europe-iraq day in baghdad .
these three peopl oper in the british compound .
there ha been no substanti progress .
we need to turn over a new leaf .
you need to be seen in baghdad , and inde in kurdistan .
appoint a head would put a stop to that .
( pl ) mr presid , europ is today face two problem .
we have been taken by surpris .
ladi ashton say there are storm in the neighbourhood .
time is a key factor in this polici and a scarc resourc .
our sin is inact .
it is the wrong approach .
we want a high repres to lead , not to follow .
our debat ha two weak .
( the presid cut off the speaker )

i prefer individu debat to a joint debat .
plea allow me to make three addit comment .
there would be no effect at all .
so let u stop moan that we do not have a common polici .
it is the european mission that ha full legitimaci .
( applaus )

ani conflict confirm this .
we need a common secur and defenc strategi .
this issu must be put on the agenda again .
without credibl , we can not be effect .

i hope that this propos will appear in your white paper .
let u align our polici with our valu .
but , a evid indic , this is not enough .
our common foreign and secur polici is at a crossroad .
the progress so far , howev , ha been quit slow .
the situat in syria is deepli concern .
brutal repress is unaccept and must be stop .
assad is isol .

first , the aim is to promot innov .
second , origin label must be improv .
it is one of the right of consum .
it is actual an indispens part of the democrat process .
in practic , this is about trust .
i would also like to contest the vote on paragraph 9 .

this ha to be defin .
doe it includ telephon meet and internet meet ?
when is it class a a meet ?

in ani case , i will never be involv in break this confid .
great progress ha been made in the last few year .
this is whi i have support the propos .
first of all , i think that it should be mandatori .
it is also in our own interest .
i find it incomprehens .
free trade is good !
free trade is good !
free trade is good !
in a way , i think this is fantast .
howev , i would like to say that i fulli support it .
i think that this is complet in line with the wto .
we are now talk about the region of japan .
the eu and japan are two of the world 's largest economi .
togeth , we account for a fifth of global trade .
systemat free trade is not necessarili benefici .
it can be a good thing when there is a level play field .
that is whi i did not vote for the major resolut .
well , enough of dogmat .
we obvious do not support this .
forest legisl is therefor best dealt with at nation level .
thank you .

i thank all the hungarian presid repres for that .
we all work togeth day and night to achiev a goal .
i invit you to take the floor on behalf of the council .
our european institut have suffer a major collect failur .
it is in this spirit that i turn to you today .
i have come not onli to speak but also to listen to you .
unfortun , this wa not to be .
we must not allow this agreement in principl to be lost .
indonesia is a key eu partner in south-east asia .
our two parliament have an excel relationship .
we hope that your visit will be fruit and benefici .
( applaus )
this wa a veri special event .

we must fill this gap .
the other propos concern clone .
we do not want these product on the european market .
that is your job and parliament is readi to support you .
i hope you will be abl to submit a propos veri soon .
that is what we have been elect for and not for anyth el .
we have been present with legal excus .
in legal term , this wa all untru .
not be abl to label is an excus .
it is technic incorrect .
it is perfect possibl to label and trace .
i think that is the crux of the problem .
what need to happen now ?
certain , we have lost some time .
it must therefor also be this parliament that conclud it .
the real key here is the ban of offspr .
we were thus unabl to reach a compromis on this issu .
the document clear state that
mr dalli , the citizen await your next move .
in my view , regul must be brought forward veri quick now .
i will hand over the document to the council .
i think this is a crucial issu from a polit standpoint .
the council did not want it .
that is the council 's posit .
i do not believ that ani of this had a basi in fact .
for exampl , minc meat must be label in the usa .
i agre with m liotard .
mani thank for that .
parliament ha not actual been inflex .
i will now get back to the substanc .
we must demand two thing : traceabl and label .
traceabl is essenti .
european consum must be abl to make an inform choic .
madam presid , i am afraid i will be le diplomat .
clone anim are veri expens to use for food .
it will be their descend that are use for food .
i am afraid that your role in the negoti wa not product .
this wa our chanc to have an agreement .
i would like to make one point .
we use the same strategi for genet engin .
what wa the end result ?
this rule also appli when talk about food safeti .
howev , this is just one side of the coin .
this is also an issu which need to be address .
we hope for your support , mr dalli .
there is a need for action .
the ban on clone is simpli one step in the process .
clone is not just a complex , but also a sensit topic .
ten of thousand of other attempt end in failur .
i have a number of doubt about the new novel food regul .
that wa our posit .
we have tri and are tri to act in this spirit .
precis what wa that ?
reason and price will set the limit .
it help in establish our posit .
let u now draw a veil over all that and look to the futur .

( the speaker agre to take a blue card question under

( lt ) thank you veri much for this question .
after all , someon ha to put theori into practic .

it is the poor regul bank that were irrespons .
it is a question of no pain , no gain .
that is whi i want to repli to you now .
the case of sweden ha been mention .
the eu did not interven here with financi aid .
in other word , a strict fiscal polici ha been introduc .
it sound veri easi and neat .
this is how it could veri like turn out .
bank would also bear the cost .
what would happen ?
it is not a kind of theoret virtual .
it is a veri like result .
a massiv credit crunch .
it would melt down .
would that help greec or europ ?
i doubt it .
who would be readi to lend to greec the morn after ?
that is the goal of this exercis .
we have exampl of this .
belgium success did so in the 1990s for almost a decad .
this is the onli way for greec to avoid much wors altern .
this debat is about the sovereign debt crisi .
it ha implic for the euro , for the futur of europ .
you know this veri well .
we need to find the energi togeth to beat this fatigu .
implement both prioriti ha reach an import , critic stage .
for greec , the stress is on put the budget in order .
the debat is close .
written statement ( rule 149 )
a for the sacrosanct market , they are now set the tone .
commiss and govern have just one ob : to reassur them .
it is time we stop this unhealthi circus .
one thing is clear to all of u .
it goe without say that the eu must respond to the crisi .
a total of 91 major european bank were test and 7 fail .
we must exert greater pressur with regard to the agenc .
there are a number of good argument for do so .
if i rememb correct , both organis were found in 1975 .
by the way , i did not make this up myself .
this is where the inform come from .
i will be happi to make these document avail to you .
i am therefor ask the follow question .
if so , may we see the criterion ?
second , how do the agenc perform against the criterion ?
we have heard about synergi ; we want to see them .
who set the object and strategi of the agenc ?
may we see them ?
we ask : is this duplic worthwhil ?
i have look at the websit of these four agenc .
the area cover by the agenc overlap .
obvious , this situat can not continu .
we must prevent duplic of effort by merg the agenc .
what respons can it give u ?
a good question .
is greec suffer ?
that is what you should work to achiev , mr andor .
therefor , be open in your think on this matter .
i think that this is a veri one-sid approach .
the same thing happen in meet in turkey .
we can not therefor underestim the role play by cedefop .
we are alreadi over time .
m gräßle , you want the floor for one minut ?
if we want to retain the agenc , we need to chang them .
i can onli ask you to join u in our effort .
that is a lot of money .
that is the point i would like to emphasis .
we owe this to our citizen and our taxpay .
i believ that there is plenti of room for improv .
elsewher , the job is done by one agenc .
how mani job have the agenc actual creat ?
otherwis , i would like to see them close .
if we find weak or wast , we have to address them .
the debat is close .
( the sit wa suspend at 19:25 and resum at 21:00 )
how can we be ?
this will not happen on it own , of cours .
so , what are the specif measur that we could take ?
we need more focus and le fragment .
what do we want to achiev ?
that therefor ha to be the polit mindset , too .
prefer , we need a holist approach .
that is the mission for u , a politician .
cut the red tape .
at the moment , that market is much too compartmentalis .
we need european version of steve job .
final , what about the averag taxpay ?
well , innov union will make the best use of public money .
thank you .
they are also the one to recov fastest from recess .
this is not the vision of the futur that we need .
that is what i understand the innov union is offer .
it need to be appli across the entir european territori .
the high-tech sector is a good exampl .
succeed in this will be a challeng for europ .
europ urgent need innov now .
i congratul mr merki on her fine report .
think about this .
this , in itself , is alreadi a major challeng .
this , of cours , radic transform the context .
a great mani thing have been said with which we agre .
there are just two point i would like to rais .
first , we need to maximis the impact of each euro spent .
we need to put an end to that .
i believ that she ha done a veri good job .
i have three point to make .
innov should ultim ensur that product last longer .
this will be of benefit to consum and the environ .
the innov union must help to combat this .
we are larg in agreement on this issu .
this is what mr merki refer to in her speech .
i would like to mention briefli one other issu .
i will never forget that even .
they onli ask for one thing .
how can we increas the effect of our invest in research ?
perhap onli a few regul are need .
a mr merki ha said , le is often more .
mr presid , mr reul , thank you for your speech .
it is a veri fine result .
we therefor need to focus on innov .
( c ) mr presid , europ and innov .
where are we , essenti ?
i believ that busi and the citizen are watch on .
we need to move to a multi-fund approach .
will you agre with this in the forthcom regul ?
what kind of propos will this be cover by ?
a re-balanc is need .
how will you now conduct the dialogu ?
how will you organis that from here on in ?
we want to see more of you .
in fact , i have a lot of faith in that .
along with mr merki , we will keep a close eye on you .
i hope that this amend will receiv major support tomorrow .
innov must not be swallow up by research .
i think that this notion is neither feasibl nor fair .
job are be creat more activ today .
the european union is at a difficult crossroad .
that is the challeng face u .
one wa the need to avoid duplic .
we also need product cooper between the various stakehold .
third , we need to develop the european patent .
most of the speaker talk about job .
that is what innov union is all about .
a number of speaker rais the role of the region .
inde , m merki underlin that point in her report .
all the region of europ should play to their strength .
it wa a veri inclus process .
so where do we go from here ?
let u not end with this one report .
let u realli tri to get a differ mindset .
let u spend the money , but let u chang the polici .
let u start a movement : a movement for innov .
the debat is close .
written statement ( rule 149 )
innov mean the success implement of idea in practic .
the return is guarante .
we believ this is best practic .
the european union must set an exampl .
we , too , must lead the way on this point .
i will tell you quit simpli .
the institut context need to be born in mind .
the new instrument will be an intern agreement .
that is whi the union can not ratifi ilo convent itself .
we will be put forward those guid principl next year .
this wa discus in connect with atyp contract .
we have mani initi in hand at the moment .
this is simpli not accept .
one solut might be the use of model contract .
i believ that contract of a similar type oper in belgium .
i would also like to thank the commission for his answer .
a lot of the work is done behind close door ; it is invis .
domest worker often occupi a real posit of trust .
migrant femal worker are veri vulner inde .
i would like to comment on four point .
first , there are gap in the definit in the ilo convent .
this is a good thing .
we should therefor professionalis it .
i would first like to highlight an initi point .
the ratio is 1:2 .
this is unaccept discrimin that must be put right .
they are also not includ in the european framework direct .
there are similar obstacl in other member state .
howev , these worker do deserv special protect .
the articl concern rest period is also problemat .
post worker immedi come to mind .
this is one way of circumv minimum work condit .
some of these peopl even have bogus self-employ status .
this is whi we have tabl this amend .
the debat is close .
the vote will take place on thursday , 12 may , at noon .

these peopl alreadi have huge problem in this area .
there is an urgent need for action here .
we are in complet agreement on this .
the european union must take determin action .

do you know how it came into be ?
tonn of antibiot are liter stuf into anim .
some of these action may requir chang in legisl .

( the order of busi wa adopt )
commemor of deport in 1941 in the baltic state
happili , this did not happen in these countri .
in mani place , almost 50 % of the deporte die .
this led to the feel that justic could never prevail .
( applaus )
we must never forget .
it must never happen again .
( applaus )
despit this , we can end on an optimist note .
more than 65 year have pas sinc the second world war .
thank you .

european environment econom account ( debat )
we therefor know exact what is happen in these area .
this is take far too long .
the commiss propos the inclus of three modul .
thus , we have achiev improv in this area .
that is our goal .
this is someth good , sensibl and import .
that is veri import .
that is a veri import point that we should includ here .
that would be the wrong approach .
mr presid , i agre with the previous speaker .
we now have an opportun to obtain these fact .
this is extrem import .
we now have an opportun to work with a broader perspect .
the current system therefor doe not work .
whi is sustain energi more expens than convent energi ?
this , howev , is just the begin .
howev , there are new shortag of natur resourc .
we need other incent to boost product and qualiti .
there is a charg on the physic recipi .
let u be frank .
so the sovietis of the eu continu .
with regard to statist , you talk of sovietis .
is this realli how you see it ?
do statist mean sovietis to you ?
mr presid , let me make the first point .
whi do we need these data ?
it ha noth to do with sovietis .
the u dollar is usual use a the currenc for comparison .
i believ that is the second element .
consid fukushima .
they are flow account rather than stock account .
whi is that ?
even someon like mr nuttal can not disagre with that .
therefor , i would say that this is a posit first step .
i would like to thank the commiss and the rapporteur .
we can no longer consid the economi and the environ separ .
the paralog of the past must stop .
mr seeber quot the exampl of fukushima .
anoth , simpler , daili exampl is that of fire .
in the long term , it will be poorer than it wa befor .
howev , they are an import step in the right direct .
there are good reason for this .
for this reason , we will abstain dure the vote .
by do so , we will have taken the first crucial decis .
thank you veri much .
plea continu with this good work .
i am not a optimist a the rapporteur and my fellow member .
on the other hand , we need transpar and compar .
i think that is import .
on the contrari , we have enter an interact phase .
european now have an environment conscienc .
let me make a few point in respons to a number of remark .
this is the first regul , with three modul .
it is the begin in term of legisl .
plea rememb that a well .
with a few except , this ha found favour here .
i also agre with mr kadenbach 's statement .
these environment account can help u in this regard .
that is whi this is now necessari .
we are also tackl this in stage .
europ is also under a global oblig , mr nuttal .
parliament should also help out in this regard .
thank you veri much .
the debat is close .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12:00 .
written statement ( rule 149 )
the commiss support this agreement .
gradual and progress .
one big step at a time .
you can tell where i am go with this .
view from this angl , too , she is an outstand candid .
there will be no intern protect without extern protect .
sinc then , howev , the situat ha chang consider .
madam presid , thank you for your respons , mr rehn .
i believ we have all found her to be a veri compet person .
it would have increas europ 's influenc .
that is someth that we lack .
whi , therefor , ha this opportun not been taken ?
the work on this reform ha begun .
we need a stronger imf that oper a a global lender .
final , mr rehn , sometim we need to make a leap forward .
that doe noth to enhanc the european union 's credibl .
this is a miss opportun a far a i am concern .
second , i should like to respond to mr swinburn .
that is how it work .
on this issu , commission , i do hold you respons .
we can not permit this state of affair a european .
i would have thought this is a veri poor choic .
it ha to be open , transpar and merit-bas .
the debat is close .
written statement ( rule 149 )
it doe not speak with one coher voic , but with mani voic .
we now have the europ 2020 strategi .
eur 26 billion ha been program for the first three year .
we need to simplifi the futur and put the past behind u .
we realli must settl this issu , commission .
next , we have the major challeng .
we must also honour our intern commit , such a iter .
that is extrem import .
of it fund , 50 % is yet to be spent .
these countri are experienc massiv econom develop .
we must simplifi the applic and report procedur .
we simpli have to deal with the bureaucraci .
that will creat better result .
that is the idea express in paragraph 9 of the report .
commission , i still think you can do more for simplif .
we also must not compromis that principl of excel .
we can not agre with this model .
i think this is an import step for parliament .
third , i strong support the mari curi action .
everyon say that we will , but it will be difficult .
how will we manag to use the exist resourc more effici ?
that is not the principl we should use for research fund .
last but not least , we must fund fewer project .
congratul on your report .
this mid-term retrospect is crucial .
i think we can be proud of this fact .
i believ this will pay dividend in the futur .
the rapporteur correct place great emphasi on this aspect .
this wa mention in mere one sentenc in the report .
in short , this is definit the number one issu !
i would just like to emphasis two point .
first , innov .
second , financ .
we all agre that the budget should match our ambit .
such pronounc should not be made arbitrarili .
that would be a signific start point .
we need simpl and clear rule , consist and rigor appli ' .
thank you .
i have a second comment to make .
excel must take root in the region and the citi .
over the come year , we need to make use of the condit .
second , mr carvalho , of cours , you have done veri well .
there is le red tape .
that simpli can not work .
you have my thank for this interim report .
i think there are three thing that should be underlin .
they will not run away with the money .
the second point is excel .
the third point is mobil .
so onc again , my thank to the rapporteur .
great prais is due to the rapporteur , mr audi .
the first one is simpl itself : simplif .
the need for simplif is absolut vital .
if we have that , then we will get result .
final , we have fail with the lisbon strategi .
this situat can not be repeat .
i would also argu that we should focus on perform .
research and innov are the key tool .
it is also about fund from the euratom programm .
it is particular strong in some eu member state .
thank you .
there were also an unpreced number of posit paper .
a you can see , on these issu , anyway , anyth can happen .
thank you for what you are do .
the word industri competit ' rais expect .
research must be transform into growth .
a mr reul said , we must , of cours , encourag excel .
excel is the key word .
the aim is better coordin with the member state .
the debat is close .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12:00 .
written statement ( rule 149 )
scienc doe not exist a an end in itself .
this would also contribut to an improv use of fund .
eu-canada trade relat ( debat )
specif commit need to be enter into on the canadian side .
howev , we have four red line .
the other area of concern is around procur .
canada is , for instanc , oppos to the eu 's gmo polici .
that is someth that we all welcom .
that is worth emphasis .
i would like to mention the trade in servic in particular .
what is clear import is to creat more free trade .
a for the environ , we are concern and call for invest .
that would be to lose our sen of perspect .
we have to tell canada to back off .
you even made refer to it yourself .
the ban ha not been ineffect .
is it the canadian court or those in the european union ?
we want to retain public servic .
our parliament should also encourag this .
i simpli do not understand the commiss .

ehec outbreak in the eu member state ( debat )
sporad case are report in 11 other member state .
switzerland ha also report 15 case and the unit state 4 .
so what is the european commiss do to tackl the outbreak ?
we do not have ani result to date .
i have been repeat : our system work .
we need to learn lesson a we go along .
we have to learn lesson on this front .
befor close , i would like to rais briefli two more point .
the first concern refer to ban on certain product .
( applaus )
i would like to do the same .
hundr of peopl are sever ill .
twenty-two peopl have alreadi die .
of cours , we still have to find the sourc .
even the spanish member must understand that .
that wa unaccept .
we need to work on this .
is it about our farm practic , a peter lie just mention ?
is it about intens farm , hot-hous fruit and veget ?
is it about overus of antibiot in livestock ?
is it about manur spread ?
i hope they will listen to this debat in the futur .
busi a usual ' is not go to be good enough .
death , unfortun , is perman .
we are discus label today .
we can not know everyth .
in this case , the precautionari principl must prevail .
the commission is right .
we must learn from the lesson of this .
you must alway learn from the lesson of your mistak .
where is the genuin decision-mak author ?
i think that would be the appropri thing to do .
ehec and antibiot resist are both major problem .
the monitor author were not prepar for this situat .
we need a radic rethink in agricultur polici .
our food must be safe .
they have fail to coordin or to manag the situat .
europ is the right stage for this purpos .
one such solut should also be found now .
clear , our thought are veri much with them this morn .
we have a great deal which need to be explain .
i agre with those who have just spoken about this .
it take too long for clear guidelin to be issu .
three week is definit too long .
europ must be involv here at an earlier stage .
we need clear countri of origin label .
( applaus )
today , it is not bean sprout .
there is an unnatur combin of strain and dna in the virus .
the bacterium cost live , too mani live .
there are serious econom consequ for farmer .
the fact is , the alert system work veri well .
feedback will have to be given .
it should be extend to a larger number of foodstuff .
this situat is dramat and it is also unaccept .
that realli should not happen in europ .
there are sever lesson we need to learn from this .
we clear need more europ .
that ha alreadi been said by other member here .
transpar is need to maintain consum confid .
let me also point out the respons of the medium .
mr presid , hearsay can be danger .
to date , we have 22 death in the eu .
ecdc is publish daili updat .
through cooper , we can control this outbreak .
abov all , we need to be calm and measur in our respons .
someth is not right , commission .
the same can not be said of the german author .
( applaus )
for me , that is not the point , either .
you can also look that up easili in the legisl .
for me , the import question is what will happen in futur ?
could there still be product method that are unaccept ?
( applaus )
mr presid , this is a real crisi .
the situat is serious .
in austria alon , sale of fresh veget have fallen by 75 % .
consum have the right to know where product come from .
this appli equal to shop shelv and to restaur and cater .
whi did the commiss echo the hurri inform from germani ?
whi such an incred time lap ?
i think that this need to be look at .
this aggress bacteria seem unstopp .
the situat in the clinic is extrem fraught .
no end is in sight .
the peopl of my home area fear new case everi day .
commission , neither cucumb or soya are the caus .
a mr lie ha said , the caus is the pathogen .
and i ask for the control system to be review .
and for mr merkel to accept respons .
and i ask her for le arrog and more dilig .
and that she be held respons for the damag she ha caus .
she can not ignor the fact that hamburg is in her countri .
she can not ignor her respons .
rapid alert , track and trace have all work .
that can not be the european union 's intent .
( sk ) mr presid , commission , i welcom this debat .
we need to be readi for situat which are even more danger .
ladi and gentleman , spanish cucumb were not contamin .
they were not contamin !
an epidem know no frontier .
i am tell you , commission : know no frontier !
we ask for compens .
this point wa made sever time just now .
this is what you will be discus this afternoon .
still , farmer are wait for the compens they deserv .
we must also urg calm in such a situat .
nation govern have been quick to apport blame .
it is germani that ha a serious credibl problem .
she is noth of the sort : she lack moral fibr .
there is perhap a lack of coordin .
at ani rate , there wa certain a lack of communic .
that should therefor be the focus of our attent .
in this case , they have left much to be desir .
everyth el can be discus later .
this will certain not be the last crisi .
who is in charg ?
there are major differ between the member state .
to sum up , there need to be clariti and drive .
( de ) mr presid , ehec is the term of the last week .
first of all , our sympathi , clear , goe to the victim .
the well-b of the peopl must come first .
peopl have to be told where this bacterium is .
we did not manag to prevent panic this time .
everi day , veget produc incur loss of pln 2 million .
sever month ago , we rais the alarm concern swine flu .
now , someth similar ha happen .
becaus of this , the crisi ha turn into hysteria .
i think this aspect of situat manag is veri import .
the debat is close .
written statement ( rule 149 )
the eu can not neglect it farmer in this situat .
the oper affect are entitl to damag .
let u therefor also tackl it in a european context .
we have undermin the confid of european and other consum .
it is no longer enough to say who and what is to blame .
the inform be receiv from veget produc is disturb .
what ha happen is a tragedi .
are there too mani antibiot in cattl fodder ?
to what extent do we need better label and trace ?
charg of heavi good vehicl ( debat )
we are not impos anyth .
that is the principl .
that is the standard .
this is what ha been agre .
it is also to be appli to the entir motorway network .
that is cast in stone in the legisl .
there ha been quit some discus about this .
to conclud , the eurovignett is no miracl solut .
we know that parliament agre with u on this matter .
we have work veri hard togeth to reach the compromis .
the commiss support this agreement .
i have note your declar on the correl tabl .
i fulli sympathis with you on this issu .
that will mean that total toll level remain the same .
parliament also find the earmark import .
you have my thank for back this compromis .
the most import and trickiest point , for me , wa earmark .
are we go to oblig them to do so ?
we did not succeed in do this .
that is one of the posit element .
i find that veri littl .
there is someth that i would like to clear up .
i do not believ that such a level play field will result .
it could be that i have misunderstood you in this regard .
i would ask you to clarifi this .
the uk ha been polit taken over .
the eu is not news .
no , becaus they are not inform .
it wa not easi to reach a compromis on this issu .
some peopl were for it , other against .
for u , that wa one of the most import point .
make transport more expens doe not make it more effici .
anoth import factor for u is interoper .
that is not sustain .
we have had this debat so mani time in this hous .
what do we want tomorrow ?
differ charg in individu member state do not .
( applaus )
the first thing you have to do , then , is cope with that .
first of all , we have the principl of extern cost .
we have the abil to charg for nois .
of cours , these are too limit and at far too low a level .
that is inexplic .
these point leav me realli dissatisfi .
that is a point on which we can all fail to be satisfi .
it wa a tough struggl , though .
( applaus )
what is in this text ?
what doe it say ?
we shall vote for this principl .
the commiss must provid impetus on this issu a well .
this is a harm concess .
we shall therefor vote for it .
the question is : how will the money be spent ?
i think this is someth which realli is controversi .
onli environment friend transport is too expens .
we have unfair competit .
on the road , the toll is voluntari .
it is cap .
on the railway , there is no limit .
( applaus )
those plan fit in well with today 's agreement .
what are the advantag of this direct ?
for me , there are three .
these , then , are control mechan .
the industri ha been declin steadili over the last decad .
foreign lorri now control 80 % of cross-channel busi .
howev , the competit is not fair competit .
this direct must be resist .
it is no exagger to talk about slave of the road .
first , eurovignett is not a european tax .
this must be made veri clear .
in that sen , it is a bad name .
second , plea accept the compromis .
this is much bigger and more complic than it look .
there are two fundament continu fight behind this .
so it is go in the right direct .
this is the direct that thing are go .
the second fight is much more continu and sharper .
this wa also veri visibl here dure the debat .
i sincer ask you to plea support this compromis .
this issu ha been up in the air for year and year .
now we are take a step forward .
we had to balanc environment and econom sustain .
had it not been import , this direct would not exist .
the transport sector is import for our economi .
that promis heat discus over the next few year .
these are thing for the forthcom year , howev .
we must first take this step forward .
the debat is close .
the vote will take place today at 12:00 .

could not europ also lend greec a hand on this matter ?
we are current address the issu of bank secreci .
mr barroso , i have just one brief question .
we are awar of how sensit this area is .
is there ani more you can tell u in this connect ?
is this a one-off , or will there be further discus ?
will you be put this on the agenda again ?
we all want an internet that is open .
we think it contribut huge to knowledg and freedom .
there wa not realli ani negoti .
it wa not exact a negoti ; i did not see it like that .
presid of the commiss . - no , i do not accept that .
unfortun , your critic of the euro area is alway ideolog .
the debt problem are not exclus .
the first thing i mention wa pan-european parti .
one other question i have is about cathi ashton .
i note her attend at commiss meet is veri low .
is the uk be correct repres at the commiss ?
presid of the commiss . - there are two question here .
she can not be at all of them .
mr presid , my apolog for the delay in my arriv .
i wait until the end a a result .
2008 wa the year of a deep crisi in bank .
this is , therefor , real auster .
i think you will like the document we adopt today .
howev , i think we are agre on the goal .
i will stick to the topic .
that wa the angl taken on the issu at the last g8 meet .
i want to reassur you on that point .
that ha been our consist posit and we will maintain it .
here , we may have complet differ point of view .
how would you explain this ?
you mention condit , which is what my question relat to .
the eurobond is urgent need , mr presid .
i think that is where we should now concentr our effort .
that is , of cours , a veri import and decis one .
that would be quit right .
what concret measur is the eu plan in this respect ?
i agre with you complet .
do these social develop worri you ?
they are a major polit issu .
i understand how difficult these time are for greec .
we will all support it .
but , at the same time , let u be honest .
it is a crisi , and we all know it is a crisi .
that is the onli way out of it .
but we know that greec ha no intent of leav the eurozon .
the question hour with the presid of the commiss is close .
sudan and south sudan ( debat )
i think mr piebalg is stand in for her .
thank you , mr piebalg .
our utmost concern would be to avoid state failur .
north sudan , on the other hand , will suffer some loss .
i must also mention darfur .
there is posit news .
last , i must mention justic .
there ha to be an end to impun .
the viabil and stabil of both north and south are crucial .
the situat in abyei is becom wors everi day .
it is most worri .
mr piebalg , i had prepar a three-minut speech .
in fact , you cover all the most import point .
i will just add a few point .
we must keep this firm in mind .
at the same time , it is excit and wonder .
they want to creat law .
sudan is onc again face a major histor turn point .
what a statist that is .
we need to build capac from the bottom up .
they do not have a civil servic .
they do not have train administr .
there are two other factor to mention , too .
is south sudan to be given a fair start ?
if not , how can we in europ help ?
the conflict that ha broken out is dramat .
i find that regrett .
this is a crush rebuk , in fact .
i hope , therefor , for european pressur on al-bashir .
this is what ha produc the disast that sudan ha becom .
this also call for attent from the intern communiti .
in the abyei region , he ha start to massacr citizen .
the live of unit nation staff there are not safe .
now , the situat in sudan is make the headlin again .
the crisi is far from over .
the live of million of peopl still depend on outsid aid .
howev , the next few month will remain critic .
infrastructur is larg non-exist .
there is widespread intercommun hostil .
the wound and violat are hard even count .
sudan wa a fail state .
it wa to mean the creation of a 54th state in africa .
i will end on a posit note .
this is a truli grotesqu undertak .
it is a countri in which the men have not learn to work .
it is not the same situat a befor .
now we see a light at the end of the tunnel .
so that is a complet new situat .
we are veri firm behind the mbeki panel .
this take time and the abyei issu certain did not help .
but that issu ha not been forgotten .
the debat is close .
the vote will take place on thursday , 9 june , at 12:00 .
written statement ( rule 149 )
applic of schengen acqui in bulgaria and romania ( debat )
parliament demand access to this inform .
my sixth and final point is that they have work hard .
we need more europ on this , and not le europ .
this must remain a prioriti .
i now add that we must help bulgaria and romania .
i trust bulgaria and romania .
these criterion essenti number five .
furthermor , we should avoid doubl standard .
this notion is complet unaccept .
the answer accord to the rule is yes ' .
i am plea that our viewpoint won the day .
institut cooper must be fair , logic and democrat .
i understand the concern about corrupt and organis crime .
the file on that evalu is thus crucial .
a danger game is be play with bulgaria and romania here .
overal , the opinion on the tabl is a posit one .
( nl ) mr presid , i will get straight to the point .
i repeat : absolut not .
it is naiv , in fact , it is childish naiv .
the fact just do not back the idea up .

of cours we should not - never !
the fact just do not back this idea up , either .
yet we are suppos to allow these countri into schengen ?
it would be an outrag , and complet irrespons .
take the blinker off !
bulgaria and romania are absolut not readi for schengen .
they are not readi now , and they never will be .
this is alreadi done .
we can not allow doubl standard .
they have good reason for so do .
it is give none whatsoev .
it is take no step whatsoev , either .
all the schengen acqui condit have been met .
we can not allow polit argument to delay the enlarg .
in summari , this propos is simpli a border too far .

anyth el is polit hypocrisi .

these are differ process , and each ha it own pace .

implement measur ( rule 88 ) : see minut
we firm believ in the efficaci of eu expenditur .
we call on the european commiss to make this a realiti .
howev , a european solut mean european fund .
i think not .
this is a concept that some peopl will support .
that is what will make u strong .
this is a good draft plan .
of cours we want to help farmer .
we have to help farmer .
of cours we want to help north africa .
we have to help north africa .
( de ) mr hartong , of cours i recognis this right .
i suppos that this repres some sort of progress .
we must chang noth at all .
there are other way to make save .
let me give you three exampl .
first of all , foreign polici .
in the u , there are 28 000 diplomat .
there is a save to be made there .
anoth exampl is monetari polici .
in the u , there are 18 000 in the feder reserv board .
that is three time fewer civil servant .
that would make enorm save in it research budget .
( applaus )
definit not : they have evolv and chang .
i would like to congratul the committe on it work .
european need to be told the truth .
our fellow citizen share our ambit and hope .
this budget need to chang direct .
that will help creat job and growth .
we need a budget which is more focus .
the third prioriti concern the eu 's own resourc .
what nonsens , complet and utter nonsens !
that is deal with money effici .
look also at infrastructur .
there , too , you need european money .
or take innov and research .
now , that is clever invest .
second , the budget must be forward-look .
the current budget is too much busi a usual ' .
we must therefor invest in that .
the eu must invest in this so that we can deal with it .
that is the innov we should be talk about .
what are the new challeng ?
for that , too , we need european money .
the third prioriti concern the eu 's own resourc .
the current system is bankrupt .
consid a financi transact tax .
this is a clever polici .
this simpli doe not add up .
howev it seem it coalit mep here favour a freez .
taxpay in the uk will not be thank them .
we shall not see them lit again in our time ' .
this concern both the legisl and the budget .
how ridicul !
there is a blue card .
mr hartong , are you readi to answer ?
that will continu to be the case .
yes , we share the vision which is contain in the report .
thank you , commission .
( in respons to a voic from the floor : )
yet , we are do someth realli peculiar .
eastern germani requir support .
cohes is link with solidar .
i would ask for your broad support .
the skill and experi of woman must be utilis .
you have both done an excel job .
other institut could have a littl more of this spirit .
growth is the basi for econom and social activ .
this is requir if we are to be honest with our citizen .
( de ) mr presid , i am happi to deal with this question .
we need to deal with increas globalis and competit .
european alreadi pay too much in govern levi .
i do not consid this to be a true altern .
thus , what we need is open to reform and polit courag .
natur , we can not just drop one element and add anoth .
whi is that ?
the confid in europ is diminish .
what we do here is not a wast of money .
natur , we are on your side on this issu .
we should work on develop this , not destroy it .
the answer , in my opinion , is no it can not .
the sovereign debt crisi prove exact that .
this report lack ambit .
it will therefor be regard a be of valu to european uniti .
we take polit decis extrem serious .
it is someth of which we can be proud .
best of all , it wa alway cheer and open .
they obvious enjoy all the hard work .
thank you veri much inde .
( applaus )
we were veri plea with this .
it is realist and achiev .
we genuin need more europ .
plea read the report .
thank you for your excel work .
this is therefor a solid achiev .
is the result suffici ambiti ?
i believ it is .
we have a grip on the eu budget .
the result is a cake that give them belli ach .
we are well awar of how bad the lisbon strategi turn out .
for these reason , i can not back the report .
i should like to welcom the repres of the unit nation .
( applaus )
on the contrari .
the transport and energi polici must be enhanc .
i wish to congratul the rapporteur , salvador garriga .
they were not in favour in econom boom time either .
the agricultur and structur budget are left untouch .
howev , more money is be sought for research and develop .
this reflect veri well the debat on the multiannu budget .
some money ha to be return to member state .
we have two option .
it is not possibl to contribut le but receiv more .
auster champion at home , big spender in brussel .
this is an outrag !
this is not demagogi but simpl ...
( the presid cut off the speaker )
it can onli be met by rais tax , cut servic , school ...
( the presid cut off the speaker )
second : what budget is requir by a currenc union ?
third : what potenti is open to u to make save ?
fourth : what budget is requir by the unit state of europ ?
fifth : what role is europ 2020 to play ?
do we want to play a role at all ?
we , the european parliament , take our respons serious .
we deal in plain speak .
what is it that we want ?
we do not want to freez the budget .
that is our strategi .
financi resourc are onli a mean of achiev the object .
this will also continu in the come year .
these cut are part of effort to exit the crisi .
involv in the european union provid ad valu .
ad valu and solidar are not empti phrase .
solidar ha specif aspect .
it doe contain reserv and they need to be request .
howev , i will give you one exampl .
it will perhap not be possibl to deal with both .
we should have set prioriti .
that doe not bode well for the futur , ladi and gentleman .
unfortun , this report propos none of these thing .
i also welcom the compromis on cohes polici .
fp8 therefor need adequ fund for the futur .
we also need partner .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
( nl ) mr presid , the key word for europ is confid ' .
how can that be achiev ?
this is unaccept .
third , invest in future-proof agricultur and industri .
the polledo report ha been a failur .
bon appetit , but be care you do not choke on it .
we need more and better europ .
we need to increas the budget .
it will be the guid for the next financi perspect .
cohes polici is also the result of the solidar principl .
overal , this request from parliament is absolut justifi .
the way i see it , this is an invit to wast money .
we therefor need to drop paragraph 73 from the report .
otherwis , the report is accept .
that is whi we need this intermedi goal .
mr pieper , can you explain whi it is a dream ?
that is my first point .
you are well awar of this .
that is whi i find your question surpris .
without prioriti , there is no leadership .
this is an ongo struggl for leadership and prioriti .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
by 2050 , that figur will be 5 % or 6 % .
in 2100 , we will make up 3 % of that popul .
all of this is start to look ridicul on the world stage .
essenti , that sovereignti remain absolut .
yet appar , even that is too much .
that is whi this hous should adopt the report .
the report recognis the valuabl role play by this fund .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
( the presid cut off the speaker )
it facilit demand to freez or to reduc eu spend .
we need more and better europ .
we have an enorm number of free day .
the commiss 's offici have up to 13 week paid leav .
neither one nor the other can oper without each other .
i believ that ...
( the presid cut off the speaker )
how ha it been abl to continu for so long ?
second , we must , of cours , also review expens .
we believ that these are the most import suggest .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
perhap that is what they mean .
well , we must be thank for small merci .
that is simpli unaccept .
( pl ) mr presid , we have achiev an import consensus .
who will pay ?
( the presid cut off the speaker )
yes ' to an independ cohes polici .
the debat is close .
the vote will take place today at 12:00 .
( the sit wa suspend for a few moment )
written statement ( rule 149 )
this would serv to creat a better balanc between region .
onc again , this is threaten the herald principl of cohes .
europ shall not be among the loser .
jean monnet warn in his time : europ ha never exist .
one must genuin creat europ ' .
regul need to be prune .
on the contrari , it should be cut .
this money can be put to better use .
it is time the eu and it budget were reform .
their reluct to increas the eu budget is quit understand .
this is not an abstract statement .
it is worth spend european money on them .
howev , i support flexibl mechan for necessari adapt .
europ is experienc a crisi .
the revenu shortfal for municip look veri similar .
first , on cohes polici , which is key to region develop .
the 5 % budget increas is reason .
it is therefor import for it fund to be increas .
i alreadi ask for it to be repair yesterday .
i would ask for the servic of a technician plea .
thank you .

revis hungarian constitut ( debat )
i have question for you .
my countri 's new constitut doe not appli such discrimin .
this reveal your real partisan bias .
i can not overlook this .
are these onli polit valu ?
they will not be approv , but the attempt is there .
european institut must not be shi at such time .
this is a union of differ cultur and differ prioriti .
what we should not toler is intoler itself .
if it is not , what next ?
are we realli not suppos to get involv ?
is this a pure hungarian affair ?
i would not say so .
that is true .
the issu of non-discrimin ...
this is becaus , first , constitut are not watertight .
that can not be the case .
it is therefor an issu for the sovereignti of all .
i would like to take this opportun to just say one thing .
( bg ) mr tavar , i have a veri brief question for you .
the idea of one nation , one empir and so on is not new .
or condemn for someth which they have not done ?
this is someth that contradict democrat valu .
this is wrong .
we should not go down this danger road .
how can you expect u to accept it ?
this is the declar that the 1949 constitut is invalid .
not just repeal , but invalid .
this is a major setback on the road of transit .
now we are .
other have mention other .
i challeng you to name them .
madam presid , my repli to m gál is a follow .
the issu wa : what is a european valu ?
what is part of our fundament right ?
you know how import symbol are in polit a well .
is there a green ombudsman in your countri ?
yes , or no ?
hungari had a green ...
( laughter )
ok , laugh if you want to .
my countri doe not have such a post .
whi did you abolish it then ?
you have not explain that , colleagu .
these valu are share by the member state .
the level of protect of human right is decreas .
these valu should be preserv .
fundament right is not a matter of subsidiar .
one last practic suggest to the hungarian govern .
i have been listen to the debat .
not one person ha actual quot from the constitut itself .
this ha noth to do with parti polit ; it is simpli a fact .
i am plea to find such sentiment in a constitut .
this may not plea all member of this hous .
therefor , we have to discus it and have to do so now .
there is still time befor the adopt of the generic law .
even the adopt of the document is question .
there wa no , or veri littl , social consult .
the new constitut rais question on an intern level .
the aforement generic law are veri danger .
we work close togeth on econom issu .
this goe against the principl of parliamentari democraci .
my countri , along with other , ha experi of this .
( hu ) mr alvaro , this is true , just one sentenc .
this critic is shame .
it could be chang so far .
it can be chang in other countri a well .
plea be specif .
becaus what you are say is too general .
( de ) madam presid , mani thank for your question .
howev , i can provid more concret exampl .
accord , i believ that we can discus such issu .
what is the problem here ?
no , i do not think it is the most modern .
i would like to hear your answer to this question .
is care about futur human be a european valu - or not ?
mayb not european , onli hungarian ?
( de ) madam presid , i hold mr landsbergi in high esteem .
howev , i am unabl to find a question in his speech .
that is not the issu at stake .
i can not see a contradict here .
mr gál , constitut and bridg must also be built by peopl .
this is what i want to say .
what wa the reason for this ?
this is not true .
commission , this is a matter of the utmost import .
it undermin the peac settlement of europ .
it undermin border between state .
it is satur with the spirit of greater hungari .
that is not all .
it bring the spirit of the balkan war to central europ .
yes , it is for hungari to decid the hungarian constitut .
i am talk , for exampl , about articl 23 .
it is here that the problem lie .
it meet with reject , howev , from hungari .
i would like to say one more thing .
first , i would like to make a correct .
madam presid , is the question for me ?
my sincer answer is : i can not answer your question .
( hu ) mr guillaum , i would like to ask you a question .
i am refer to articl d for mr weber 's benefit .
this is my first question .
this is my answer .
the major at the expens of the minor .
this is go back in time , not move with the time .
we expect better of our eu presid .
whi are we have this debat then ?
who did you pas them on to ?
i would like to hear some answer from you about that .
thank you for your attent .
( hu ) madam presid , commission rede , i am address you .
these are all extrem import and extrem danger element .
plea , do your job !
now it is the turn of the constitut .
the world is final back to right .
i do not see anyth objection in this .
i hope he would like to repli .
we should not violat our own treati on european union .
this is not a matter in which we should get involv .
the european court of human right is not in luxembourg .
it is locat in strasbourg .
that is the crucial point .
this is irrespons behaviour .
fidesz wa given a two-third major mandat to do this job .
that is how we answer when european law is at stake .
constitut are not within our compet .
all the member have had an opportun to speak .
the debat is close .
written statement ( rule 149 )
it will come into forc earli next year .
we are a nation that love freedom and democraci .
this is an issu of protect our common valu .
european arrest warrant ( debat )
it is high time that this discus wa brought to the tabl .
none of these requir ha realli been met in full .
i think not .
they includ hussain osman , one of the 2005 london bomber .
he came back within six week , from itali .
i think we need to reconsid that .
that need to be made explicit , and not implicit .
whi is this happen ?
doe the text of the direct leav too much leeway ?
is it not in fact much more of a frankenstein 's monster ?
should she not accept that ?
crime is not nation ; crime is intern and cross border .
that is whi we need to cooper across border .
a an instrument , howev , it is indispens .
this is what is happen now in the case of julian assang .
there are mani irregular in the swedish case against him .
mr assang ha not yet been charg with ani specif offenc .
whi would the usa want mr assang to be extradit to sweden ?
the european arrest warrant offer the perfect expedi .
there are simpli no real safeguard .
it is : can it be abus ?
will they plea do so now ?
he spent two month in prison for this , in appal condit .
ten day ago , he wa transfer to poland .
in addit , four new charg were sudden ad to his sheet .
that is whi my group is pin it hope on the commission .
what you see today is a rare occurr here .
it is essenti that we do not make the same mistak again .
howev , such ass should alway be made by the issu author .
furthermor , we should not ignor the victim .
a lot ha alreadi been said about the success .
that is the reason whi the commiss ask for action .
all these procedur right appli to the arrest warrant .
this is someth that wa said by an irish judg .
( e ) no , mr dartmouth .
one is the lack of proport .
we have mani constitu affect by this .
the most notabl case is andrew symeou .
i sat through the appeal court hear and heard the judg .
you talk about the appeal procedur .
this should be the subject of serious consider .
i agre with his last remark a i heard it in translat .
( nl ) i make no secret of that , mr stoyanov .
his name is mr cor disselkoen .
howev , often they are disregard .
what do you intend to do about this commission ?
this is piffl !
i wa there in the hous of lord and i help move that amend .
lack of evid is no bar to extradit .
they clear fall under the power of the member state .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
well , now she is put her headphon on .
in my opinion , the commiss should be prepar for that .
i do not believ that this is what wa intend .
it ha brought justic to mani victim .
all of these can , must and are be dealt with .
the negat element are in the implement .
those negat element have to be elimin .
i hope i can also count on the member state .
the system work .
it is not perfect .
it should be improv further .
better implement is , i think , in the interest of u all .
i think that those who mention this were right .
the debat is close .

eu-russia summit ( debat )
overal , our relat have improv over the last two year .
our interact is quit intens .
nevertheless , mani signific bilater issu remain unresolv .
energi also figur promin in our deal with moscow .
what are our prioriti ?
first of all , the partnership agreement .
we need to set the negoti in motion .
the negoti on the energi chapter are also behind schedul .
the elect will be the acid test .
last , the import ban on european veget ( ... )
( the presid cut off the speaker )
i hope that the negoti will not take too long .
howev , russia also need to play it part .
we need more democraci and le corrupt .
we must absolut reject that .
that is someth we reject .
i hope that we will soon make some progress on this .
we want to see proper , fair elect in russia too .
howev , russia is readi for democraci .
that is our desir and our vision .
ladi and gentleman , russia is not china .
furthermor , russia must abid by her own constitut .
we can not accept this .
russia is not a matur liber democraci .
neither is it a countri which enjoy an independ judiciari .
fair elect start with allow the registr of parti .
it result and conclus should be publish a soon a possibl .
this is the case whether we like it or not .
we must make this partnership a posit and construct one .
we have a share respons in the global world .
russia is inde at an import crossroad .
one can also put a posit slant on this .
this open up new opportun for effect cooper .
i would therefor urg the commiss to step up the pace .
( applaus )
we have not succeed in resolv anyth new sinc then .
we altern between cooper and confront with russia .
yet what is modern without democraci ?
is that the best we can expect in this area ?
do we expect noth more of russia 's democratis ?
two summit a year is too much .
let u have one summit , a we do with america .
we have enough exchang with russia in the specialist area .
russia is the eu 's third biggest trade partner .
eu export to russia total eur 65.6 billion .
that is the onli way we will make ani progress .
this is noth short of blackmail .
major chang have occur in the world sinc the last one .
climat chang ha brought more and more danger consequ .
our union must share it bed with a bear .
( nl ) madam presid , first of all , a veri urgent issu .
just one more brief question .
georgia ha , in fact , play a key role here .
georgia ha de facto the right of veto .
presid saakashvili is rais the stake .
howev , russia doe not seem to be budg at all .
it veri much look like it .
the nord stream issu is typic in this respect .
russia must observ certain rule a regard the wto .
the kaliningrad oblast may repres an except to this rule .
this is a great opportun to gain independ from russia .
so far , unfortun , there is no real progress .
it is therefor up to the eu to make one issu veri clear .
we can help russia come to term with it past .
russia certain ha no right to a sphere of influenc .
it sure ha the right , howev , to safeti and intern secur .
the european union and russia are mutual depend .
i would ask you to rais this issu .
we need a common foreign affair and secur polici .
we also need to speak clear on human right .
we can not afford to compromis here .
this is a major campaign .
i have one request .
we should also bring new idea for mutual benefici cooper .
european produc need new opportun to sell their product .
we can not agre to this .
this is whi all the relev agreement need to be revis .
we have seen that we have converg view on mani subject .
let me comment on some of these area .
first : elect .
third : the partnership for modernis .
we have talk about some of these problemat aspect today .

perhap i might make anoth comment befor go further .
that is not appropri in this case .
this take u to what is at the heart of the petit .
thing have therefor chang somewhat in ani case .
it concern an area of 10 hectar or of 20 hectar or more .
there wa then offici doubt on our part .
construct is alreadi complet .
mr potočnik is current work on a revis of the eia direct .
( applaus )
i would like to add one or two polit ass , if i may .
there are mani petit on this .
we see no need to interven ' .
we austrian are veri keen skier .
for that , of cours , you need ski run .
in this case , it seem that thing went wrong .
in mani case when thing go wrong , noth happen .
i consid what you have said to be veri import .
i have just one supplementari question .
we are talk here about a project in damüls-mellau .
these are two small communiti .
i believ that there is no reason to reproach these author .
substanti payment have been made .
that must also be state .
final , we should probabl also carri out a polit apprais .
too often , we can not see the wood for the tree .
rule must alway be follow to the letter and right so .
this is where the big problem lie .
natur is there to be use by the peopl .
of cours , i do not mean that entir serious .
what doe mr potočnik have in mind ?
we will give you a written answer on this issu .
the debat is close .
mislead busi directori ( debat )
this is not accept .
let me remind colleagu what we are talk about here .
this is whi we are here today .
but there is a lack of effect legal remedi and enforc .
the 2006 direct ha been implement by all the member state .
thank you veri much for your broad support on this matter .
commission , obvious , there is a legisl framework .
we are with them in their day-to-day live .
we need to resolv this issu immedi .
nevertheless , there is no need to introduc new legisl .
she also felt veri foolish .
i met an elder ladi whose husband wa a taxi driver .
i could not tell her not to pay the money .
that wa the best advic i could give her .
there is an ambigu here .
this is a cross-bord crimin activ .
they never hear anoth thing .
howev , these peopl must also be imprison .
final , we must sever punish those involv in this system .
we hear about survey , inform gather , and stakehold meet .
the directori compani play on that uncertainti .
a soon a they find a crack , in they go .
they have found two crack here .
you need to act and to act quick .
it is unaccept that more and more citizen are be scam .
we have been wait for these action for over 20 year .
this is not good enough .
it is a simpl a that .
i urg the commiss to appli the acceler legisl procedur .
in my opinion , a europol investig is also warrant .
mani entiti are deter from take legal action by the cost .
and yet we are not powerless in this matter .
i would like to ask you to take the problem serious .
second , there is often a failur to prosecut .
we will start work on this immedi .

you will have enough speak time afterward .
( applaus and heckl )
anyway , they are your rule of procedur .
you are a member of parliament and i am not .
the subject of human error is fulli cover .
howev , one area which wa not includ is crime .
there are two reason for this .
the first is pure formal .
we want to submit an interim report in novemb .
my parti membership is a privat matter .
( applaus )
that is what make a differ in polit .
mr harm , we have fail in parliament .
we have not done our job and neither have you .
howev , the commission ha done his job .
i am not tri to say that everyth is exact how we want it .
the resolut wa here on the tabl and you vote against it .
that is a fact .
i have had enough of this constant hypocrisi .
it is dishonest and it doe not allow u to make progress .
it is naïv to believ that we can do what we want .
( applaus )
we can do this .
we had this problem befor fukushima .
we need to exert more pressur and show more initi .
the assur that they will be safe are onli empti assur .
what kind of a pictur of solidar and moral is that ?
i can not speak on behalf of the german govern .
in this respect , i think that your remark are justifi .
ladi and gentleman , let u all calm down a littl .
now i must tell you we are not total satisfi .
whi is this ?
the propos stress test are , howev , too weak .
this is unfortun not the case .
that is a problem .
the safeti of nuclear power plant is a european issu .
the uk nuclear regulatori system is larg non-prescript .
we also know about the problem in the monitor system .
howev , today you have made a big mistak .
this is what we will judg you on again .

( the presid cut off the speaker )
i have often visit chernobyl , includ the exclus zone .
let u therefor go on with the debat
radioact radiat doe not stop at nation border .
you need to keep a critic distanc from them .
is a joint review of stress test now requir ?
it is surpris that they have not been carri out befor .
you need to make sure that the test are genuin comprehens .
the area of human failur is incomplet .
that is precis what is not be test .
this realli must be includ in the stress test .
it is high time that the euratom treati wa revis .
( de ) madam presid , i have a question for mr strejček .
neither do they predict terrorist attack .
that is what we can not accept , commission .
that is not true .
this is a global issu .
i hope that the commission will be there .
in my opinion , that is how we can cope with this issu .
radioact contamin is transboundari in natur .
this wa sore felt after chernobyl and fukushima .
both project have similar problem .
we need comprehens stress test .
fukushima ha shown that we must imagin the unimagin .
( fr ) madam presid , we actual have two question face u .
the first is about the nuclear share in europ .
i do not have much faith in self-regul .
the third principl is that this mechan should be bind .
this wa veri good news and a veri good decis .
we are wait for it to be implement .
that is dishonest and this is whi we are critic of you .
we need to take an honest look at this issu .
he ha struggl and he ha achiev a great deal .
this is the first step , but we must go further .
we need to amend the direct .
we need to extend it to cover our neighbour countri .

the euratom treati must be revis .
therefor , full mark to you , commission .
thank you and good luck .
they were bad need .
the onli thing that worri me is this fals sen of secur .

let me now turn to justic and home affair .
let me touch upon the free movement of person .
let me now say some word on croatia .
serbia ha taken a giant step toward eu access .
at the end i will also make some comment regard greec .
first , we have the econom govern packag .
agreement on this packag is vital .
the propos will have three aim .
( applaus )
the second major issu for the european council is migrat .
migrat , let u face it , is a veri emot issu .
this doe not mean roll back the abolit of intern border .
we must not let them down .
so let u act upon it .
( applaus )
this will be done within the exist fund .
( applaus )
therefor , she know what parliament is all about .
my group , ladi and gentleman , is call for a shake-up .
we simpli want an assur that they will be compli with .
i call on everyon in this chamber to recognis that .
i believ that we should be under no illus .
i read an interest line in a german newspap this week .
we are in a sever crisi .
we are in a crisi of confid in the european project .
we all have the crisi that we deserv .
our problem have been known for a long time .
we do not need le europ , we need more of it !
( applaus )
whi do we need more europ ?
this council meet is main about two thing .
who is behind them ?
who is actual pay the credit rate agenc for their rate ?
they are clear not work simpli for a reward in heaven .
the onli way that they can do this is by unit .
( applaus )
solidar mean share .
strong shoulder more so than weak shoulder .
if i sell a financi product , i pay no tax .
that is not right .
therefor we need this financi transact tax .
( applaus )
all of these thing have been explain .
they are on the tabl .
( applaus )
let u be honest about anoth thing : the crisi is not over .
that is the key question for the tomorrow 's council .
if so , we need a posit plan for it .
they can not emerg from the crisi base onli on auster .
let u , for exampl , give guarante for privat invest .
privat invest no longer exist in greec .
let u give them loan from the european invest bank .
( fr ) i am go to make my comment in french .
we need to be veri clear on that .
( applaus )
that is what we need .
i experienc this in belgium for nine year , mr lang .
mr presid , let u be veri honest .
i would ask you , mr barroso , to rectifi this .
you can play a major role in this .
i am count on you .
what doe greec have a duti to do ?
that is the truth .
at the same time , it can not be defend at ani cost .
we are sure on the final page of the bail-out chapter .
so let u act accord .
this is not a crisi of europ .
( applaus )
we are still in favour of it .
this parliament ha express it support for this mani time .
that is also your respons .
thank you for your attent .
howev , everyth is just continu a befor .
the consequ can still be felt today .
thing will just carri on a befor .
howev , we lack the courag to do this .
the caus of the crisi are not be dealt with .
that is where the problem lie .
we must continu down this rout .
what a fine mess you have got u into .
then , and onli then , can real auster packag work .
we were part of the exchang rate mechan .
it cost 1 million british peopl their job unnecessarili .
we learn our lesson .
we did not join the euro , thank god .
europ will deliv ' , he said .
what doe mr barroso actual base this power upon ?
is it not the case that they are also allow to say no ' ?
the power of the commiss is expand further and further .
it is time we put a stop to that .
mr barroso wa not elect democrat .
no european citizen vote for this man .
grant aid to greec is useless .
it harm the dutch economi and dutch citizen .
on that point , mr barroso wa actual right .
we have made an impact ass .
so we will come forward with that propos by octob .
( applaus ) .
the second issu wa rais by mr verhofstadt .
we have been support your ambiti posit .
the commiss support the communiti approach .
these are the concret answer to the concret question .
i would just like to add two thought on this matter .
allow me to add a few word with regard to greec .
mr verhofstadt mention a few problem .
howev , it will not work without growth .
doe he also see it in this way ?
there is absolut no point in deni that .
this situat can be abus from two differ side .
these measur are a step in the right direct .
i want to make that absolut clear .
in other word , no abus from either side .
that is extrem import .
that is the next big test .
i believ that what ha been said here is right .
the peopl in greec need a light at the end of the tunnel .
that is whi a growth strategi is so import .
democraci ha to endors this .
we must prevent futur crise .
this is where this revers qualifi major come in .
no ordinari citizen will understand what that actual mean .
then we will not be abl to support this packag .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
therefor , mr graf lambsdorff sure ha noth to answer .
what are we greek politician and the greek peopl ask for ?
we are ask for your respect and your solidar .
what can we promis ?
allow me to make three propos : ... ..
( the presid cut off the speaker )
democraci ?
libya is a war zone .
rule are man-mad and can be unmad .
member state have been chang beyond recognit by migrat .
the time ha come to stop the flow and encourag it revers .
the access of croatia is also on the agenda .
we have reach a histor moment .
these answer , howev , are close interconnect .
we do not need more technic solut .
in fact it is steer by sight , with no precis aim .
itali ha receiv them .
unless there is proof to the contrari , that is the truth .
last there is the croatia chapter .
what exact is avail to u ?
the european union is .
i think that is the onli feasibl way forward .
this wa disastr over the issu of greec 's fraudul statist .
the first concern greec .
that is how europ is go .
let u look at the case of greec .
let u talk about greec , then .
greec is not just ani countri .
that is not the right path .
in other word , greec must regain it credibl .
i believ that is what is at stake .
no match can be won by play alon , howev .
the greek crisi could have been control in it earli stage .
last , we should speak plain about immigr .
agreement must be reach on the mean of econom govern .
the schengen area ha been a major talk point recent .
the evalu mechan obvious need to be revamp .
reintroduc border unilater is not a solut .
nobodi is blameless in this respect .
in exact the same way it mean one for all .
latvia act too and is clear back on track .
all for one and one for all .
we all have to act in reform our societi .
but this is not help u .
in libya , the popul ha doubl in the last 20 year .
i am plea that this is the case .
if this is lack then we will never practis what we preach .
greec wa veri much present in most of our intervent .
we can help greec to increas administr capac .
we know how to help countri improv their educ system .
the time is right and this would be a high respons gestur .
a conclud remark on croatia .
the last word of thank goe to m enikő győri .
thank you for organis this debat today .
let me start with econom issu .
first , becaus this packag is good .
we have even achiev concess on revers qualifi major vote .
i thank parliament for their cooper .
the debat is close .
written statement ( rule 149 )
i am wonder what the outcom of this council will be .
this is a long process which requir sacrific to be made .
howev , the integr effort are reward in the end .
denmark wa plan to take a decis to this effect .
there is a long histori of cooper in the danub region .
the treati of lisbon give u that possibl .
i believ that there will be cross-group opposit to this .
that is a core demand of our compromis .
the import of young farmer is mention .
i intend to develop specif legisl propos on these point .
i wa interest to read your propos regard young farmer .
thank you onc again for this report .
i am happi to answer ani question .
i hope that this will be a veri product discus .
we must enabl the preserv of the environ in which we live .
mr presid , my apolog !
plea start time .
they are a follow .
it is time to move away from the use of histor payment .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
in my opinion , it is both balanc and ambiti .
we will be vote on the report tomorrow .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
let u not lose sight of that fact .
we can not accept a budget cut .
so there is no need to cap them .
i hope we can improv the report tomorrow .
i listen to the talk about green .
we have got to get our head around this somehow .
mr le foll is right .
we have got to look at how we spend the money .
are we spend our money a wise a we can ?
is there not too much of it go on administr ?
is there not too much go on bureaucraci and red tape ?
and is not enough be given toward food secur ?
what are we do to achiev food secur ?
we could be face a crisi in the next nine or ten year .
i believ that we have achiev these object with the report .
this , too , is incorpor into the report .
then taxpay will be prepar to pay for it .
this , too , is in the report .
parliament ha prove itself capabl of make such polici .
it is also import that degress is includ .
this wa support by a larg major in committe .
it is high time that we made a start on this .
we are all agre that a strong second pillar is import .
we also need far more research fund in europ .
( the speaker conclud off-microphon )
did anyon el not hear the english interpret ?
perhap it is just a local problem in the back row .
we are look into the matter .
appar it wa a channel mix-up .
we are work on the problem .
that is not what we think , of cours .
at the same time we must seek to make farm busi competit .
this hous can not accept a rural develop fund cut .
there are all sort of exampl i could give here .
environment servic can not be paid for there .
let u demand equal .
yes , i agre with you .
i think that this report mark a huge step forward .
howev , the import thing is that we reach a consensus .
the first phase is complet .
i think that is import .
in my opinion , this wa anoth fundament point .
this is not a question of ideolog .
we need to come up with unequivoc respons .
that is essenti what we are wait for .
that aid wa part of the common agricultur polici budget .
the report clear outlin a new direct - agricultur green .
in the futur we must improv it .
the world is short of food .
that is the cours we are current set .
it is too much of a strain on our farmer ' financ .
after all , europ is not alon in the world .
i veri much welcom this develop .
i can not support such develop .
european agricultur ha a great stori to tell .
now is not the time to fall out over minutia .
( el ) madam presid , we obvious need a strong cap .
the current market measur need to be reinforc .
we also need a perman crisi manag fund .
we want a sustain , ecolog and social agricultur polici .
we want green and we want it in the first pillar .
if this is done , there will be no reform .
everyth will then stay the same a it is .
that will be quit inexplic to the citizen of europ .
these are tough time and budget are not limitless .
they lack focus and they are too complic .
we have negoti good compromis on these point .
that will benefit everyon in rural area .
we need to have suffici fund to respond to these challeng .
we stand for competit and sustain agricultur in europ .
a solut need to be found here that is fair to both side .
environment programm are expens .
we need a strong first pillar .
we will support you , commission , in these effort .
innov , research and develop are of key import a well .
programm for young farmer are also just a import .
what do we think of the des report ?
well it is a bit like the legendari curat 's egg .
part of it are good .
we must suppli safe and high-qual food at afford price .
this is what consum expect .
we must care for the environ when produc and process food .
market regul are therefor import .
good price and market stabil guarante an incom for farmer .
the cap must respond to this challeng .
i believ that this is what the des report doe .
i want to make that point .
i think it is high time to give up the histor approach .
there are major imbal there , too .
the commiss is propos more target direct payment .
that is the kind of instrument that we will be propos .
european agricultur is a posit factor .
my report therefor had a substanti buffer .
we are abl to offer you that .
the debat is close .
the vote will take place on thursday 23 june 2011 .
written statement ( rule 149 )
this hous ha reach a compromis in the report under discus .
after all , their primari role is to produc food .
these payment are import for long-term plan .
i fulli support this posit .
consum make great demand of organ produc .
we are gambl with the futur of the eu itself .
the cap doe , howev , need to be tweak to make it fairer .
the next item is the joint debat on the follow report :
these issu should be at the heart of the polit agenda .
they are also grade , which is an import aspect .
agreement on a balanc , high-qual text is in sight .
my first word is one of confid , in a posit vein .
so let me first talk about the direct that i have work on .
account and forecast perform will be independ evalu .
briefli on the other direct .
inde , i said i thought it would be irrespons .
certain , that wa my group 's motto in these negoti .
in our estim , substanti improv are need .
we have therefor firm up the rule .
we have introduc penalti for fraud .
symmetri is an import issu .
we want to put those propos back on track .
tomorrow , we will be vote on the report .
that is whi this hous ha propos the revers vote procedur .
we are face an import and histor day .
mr presid , that is no spirit of compromis .
we did not do that ; instead we chang the rule .
now it is time to rectifi this .
this packag is import .
i would like to say a big thank you to my fellow member .
we work hard togeth .
we realli appreci what he ha done .
that is someth that europ need .
whi is that ?
we can not afford for this to happen ani longer .
the european council is meet on thursday and friday .
this is necessari .
unfortun , that is what the origin propos wa like .
i am plea that we were abl to rectifi that .
this is an import matter of principl .
this is also extrem import .
that is someth that we will also do in parliament .
then we can have the legisl that europ so bad need .
i warm welcom the text that you have finalis .
a we know , the council agre with almost all of them .
i will come back to that a well .
i could go on and on .
this is a veri good result for parliament and for europ .
let me say a few word on the next step .
i am worri .
that will not work .
i believ you are all awar of the effort we have made .
the commiss support revers qualifi major vote .
i believ a solut can and must be found .
let me conclud with a simpl messag .
you have agre on 99.9 % of the substanc .
mr ford spoke of it a a power struggl .
it is not a power struggl , it is a question of democraci .
we need to respect the rule of the stabil and growth pact .
to put it blunt , it simpli fail to pull the ripcord .
my group certain take the view that we need to do that .
we think that this is veri wrong .
what messag doe the council and commiss have for them ?
what messag for them ?
what messag from the council this week ?
well , i expect noth quit frank , noth .
it is this hous that will confer ownership .
some prefer intergovernment .
this is a fundament reserv .
mr presid , the green want econom govern .
howev , there wa not the slightest sign of this .
none of this is to be found in the econom govern packag .
this is reserv for the commiss .
today we are see the dramat consequ in greec .
tomorrow it will probabl come down to everi last vote .
thank you for your attent .
unfortun , that is not the case .
exact the opposit is true .
that is what the voter expect of u .
we do , in fact , want to equip you to do so .
you have derail it , and that is a piti .
consequ , this packag is by no mean balanc .
we will continu to fight for a better econom packag .
we owe this to our elector .
everyon will be affect .
europ 's leader have hesit and creat uncertainti .
the nervous ha spread .
their messag chang from day to day .
greec use deceit to enabl it to join the euro area .
that is true .
mr bullman can ask the swedish member of his group .
that is not good compani to keep .
such limit have been exceed in this crisi .
this ha shaken peopl 's faith in the process .
we can not support that .
there is a great deal of discus about greec .
we can no longer close our eye to the situat .
some may say these idea are elementari .
howev , when one co-legisl , one must be respons .
it is an exercis in respons that is now in need .
we have negoti with all the group .
respons mean walk .
realiti ha now caught up with u .
the eu is now tri a new approach .
to speak metaphor , it ha one last shot .
the pact for the euro may possibl be toothless .
what we need are bind recommend from the commiss .
that is the lesson to be learn from the euro crisi .
i do have some point of critic , howev .
i have had theolog debat on this issu with mr goulard .
we could not agre , but i admir her a an oppon .
that realli would read like eu econom for dummi ' .
they admit that they are work on a pure intuit basi .
i think we do .
thus , manag sanction is necessari .
you can not ask a skeleton to tighten it belt .
what do we need , then ?
obvious , this should never have been allow to happen .
we are therefor against them .
composit of parliament : see minut
avoid europ 's commit to invest and employ is not accept .
we must pledg our commit to europ and do it quick .
we need to move forward , not backward like crab .
europ must not hide when it is need most .
the propos befor u grant the commiss sweep new power .
it wa the greek communist .
fortun , the euro is stabl both intern and extern .
that is where we must start .
that is whi i say it is high time that we act .
parliament ha been call for measur for a long time .
the hungarian presid ha negoti well , a ha our side .
that is the wrong way to go .
in other word , your econom model doe not work .
realli , mr bütikof , you should know better by now .
we also object to that and chang it .
you were in the govern at the time , mr bütikof .
now , howev , it is for the greek to ...
( the presid cut off the speaker . )
( fr ) mr presid , i have two point .
first , greec : let u not tri to re-writ histori .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
the problem can not be solv by throw more money at it .
to u , this packag is not suffici and it is not balanc .
what should be the object for a more integr econom polici ?
for me , person , that is not consist .
we must now have the courag to decid what action is need .
we risk confus caus and effect .
this is the heterogenesi of purpos .
i fear that this problem lie at the heart of this packag .
all of u , includ the council .
the packag is good and deserv to be vote through .
what we are now do is restor budgetari disciplin .
howev , when someth is good it is not necessarili enough .
the speech we have heard today have shown sever thing .
that ha not been the case .
i welcom the issu of eurobond .
there are two thing to which we need to open our eye .
the second item relat to the scope of this packag .
howev , we must remain firm on this principl .
deficit and sustain growth can not go hand in hand .
( the presid cut off mr lull )
would you be prepar to confirm this to parliament ?
( de ) mr presid , ladi and gentleman , time is run out .
what are the caus of the crisi ?
it is not function proper at the moment .
we want to increas our level of integr .
we stand by these result .
we want to resolv the open issu and bring about integr .
( de ) mr presid , i would like to ask mr kara a question .
we are in the midst of a crisi in the singl currenc .
we have been heavili commit to this for year .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
i can not imagin a longer-term perspect in this situat .
yet they were onli mandatori criterion on paper .
they also introduc a new procedur for excess imbal .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
mr presid , compromis is wise .
the problem will not go away .
in the long run the eu is an econom union .
we need to get to the core reason for the problem .
the council , like parliament , is respons for european .
prevent is better than cure and this is all about prevent .
learn from what we have learn alreadi .
howev , do you realli think you are on the right track ?
and how do we intend to get out of it ?
through more neoliber and auster .
you are on the wrong track .
we are talk about a europ of the futur .
we say that privat invest is the solut to the problem .
the privat investor have gone elsewher .
we tend to forget that .
they have gone to other area of the planet .
what we ... ..
( the presid cut off the speaker )
unfortun , this is not the case .
the econom govern that is be propos ...
( the presid cut off the speaker )
the experi of recent year make that clear .
this is a step toward the introduct of eurobond .
introduc new debt will exacerb the european debt problem .
( the presid cut off the speaker )
prevent is easier than cure .
we are treat the symptom rather than elimin the caus .
that is whi it deserv your support .
never again .
that is the first build block of this legisl packag .
that is veri clear .
we discus all aspect of all the propos at various level .
i believ it is essenti for u to do so .
that , then , is the appeal that i am make here .
the packag also form part of the euro 's defenc .
that is the exampl that we must set here .
you can not say that , becaus it is not true .
we want a grow european economi .
we want stabil .
we certain want transpar .
i want to make a simpl point .
citizen expect the law to be appli equal to everyon .
this is an import issu : it is part of the agreement .
we need to be unit .
i am appeal for uniti , therefor .
they are readi to do it in public .
they are plan ahead for econom dialogu .
thank you .
ask them to go a bit further still : this is all we ask .
we now have a packag befor u .
we have achiev a great deal .
- the debat is close .
the vote will take place on thursday 23 june 2011 .
written statement ( rule 149 )
this is all veri well .
that is a mistak , howev .
we are at a turn point .
we are thus approach a crossroad .
spent fuel and radioact wast ( debat )
let me give you a littl more detail on our posit .
in the itr , we have essenti reinforc the financ requir .
in this context , we have refer to the aarhus convent .
our committe is in favour of region cooper .
the commiss 's first propos wa not adopt in 2003 and 2004 .
they support and strengthen the commiss 's approach .
the start posit of all the member state is differ .
we want to put in place a european legal framework .
it is import that the financ is also transpar .
we will submit these propos to the council on your behalf .
my last point concern export .
this is also a concern in this case .
the export of radioact wast to third countri must be ban .
ten thousand year ago we were live in cave .
i therefor welcom the commission 's remark on this .
that is a moral imper , and we must fulfil it .
no countri should becom anoth countri 's dustbin .
i find this irrespons .
unfortun , she wa right .
howev , that is not enough .
mr oetting , i would like to congratul you .
in principl , you are right .
howev , we are all citizen of europ .
this is not serious go to happen .
you have talk about support for the export ban .
you are call for transpar .
nobodi is against transpar .
i approv .
in that regard , you have my unqualifi support .
are you definit sure this is the safest method ?
to my mind , it is not .
nor is it one that is use anywher el .
the problem of radioact wast need to be address and solv .
the first is the ban on the transfer of wast .
i do not think that there is a conflict .
i agre that we should includ your suggest in the procedur .
thank you veri much for your cooper .
the debat is close .
the vote will take place on thursday 23 june 2011 .
written statement ( rule 149 )
that is an unaccept risk .
one-minut speech ( rule 150 )
τhe next item is one-minut speech .
in the dictionari this word mean complet distort .
polit pervers mean noth but lie and cynic decept of voter .
it turn out that they promis one thing , and do anoth .
i believ you will agre that that is pervers .
thank you for your attent .
the common currenc can not go on like this .
i do not see anyth happen in that direct .
one can not ignor the will of peopl forev .
the profession politician have made a mess .
let the peopl decid .
first and foremost , a strong , fair and well-financ cap ;
i have three other point to mention :
more opportun for our livestock farmer ;
greater flexibl in the second pillar ;
our economi are among the most dynam in europ .
busi in europ must remain competit .
in a few month croatia will enter the union .
this is the highest-risk profess in russia today .
today we also have the statement of the venic commiss .
i demand explan .
yet the victim wa none of these peopl .
that conclud the debat on this item .
now it is clear back on the polit agenda .
that is a good thing .
it is not onli a climat argument ani more .
that is veri import .
that is crucial .
so what is in the report ?
let me be veri clear .
who could be oppos to this ?
in addit , we have a respons to the rest of the world .
that make a total of 30 % .
i hope that this will not be water down .
the amend to paragraph 3 would destroy the entir report .
the climat is affect by cycl last sever centuri .
i will therefor vote against .
burn gas and coal will , of cours , result in co2 emiss .
our polici must be viabl and realist .
it is a new idea which is open to discus .
howev , i do not agre with the automat mechan .
what do i mean by that ?
we believ it would be wrong to move product deliber .
one thing is clear .
then we would have put our money on the wrong solut .
we will be happi to meet your demand .

2012 draft budget trilogu ( debat )
so here is a part of our answer in the 2012 budget .
this is the first part of the answer .
it is not enough to draft a budget .
there is our common oblig to respond to develop global .
this is especi the case of the southern mediterranean .
the result is a it wa present .
the experi of the 2011 procedur wa veri instruct .
who is respons for this ?
which countri wa the biggest offend in 2010 ?
the unit kingdom .
all the british programm were stop in 2010 .
whi is that ?
it is becaus the rule are too complic .
there are a lot of opportun open to u for innov .
we should take a brave step forward .
the updat regul must be manag effici right from the start .
she set a veri good exampl .
that is , of cours , absolut right .
ultim , this is all about small and medium-s busi .
the same appli to fine and interest on late payment .
mr presid , i welcom the commission and my fellow member .
we have identifi our goal to achiev this .
we must implement the europ 2020 strategi .
we can not say that this will onli stop later .
the sooner the better .
this is an absolut critic issu for the next two year .
fail project should be discontinu .
therefor , we welcom the work that mr balzani ha done .
these are alarm figur .
we must do much more for young peopl .
infrastructur invest is also crucial .
we obvious need to find a solut to this .
we must support it .
unfortun , ad valu and demonstr it are two differ thing .
i think that ha to be our target .
otherwis , we simpli will not be abl to meet them .
budgetari polici play a crucial role in this .
thank you , and i congratul the rapporteur .
the budget is therefor a focal tool .
the debat is close .
the vote will take place today at 12:00 .
written statement ( rule 149 )
the crisi may burden the common budget more than plan .
the next item is the joint debat on the follow report :
we want to strengthen the principl of multi-level govern .
eu law must be implement befor eu money is made avail .
this appli to public procur and to price regul .
i am keen to see how this is handl in the vote .
thank you veri much for your attent .
strateg report is also an evalu of the ongo process .
the report focus on citi and their role in cohes polici .
i would like to rais sever point in my introduct .
third , i would like to mention the theme of partnership .
partnership is often an empti concept .
much ha alreadi been said on the topic of jessica .
in the real world , howev , not much is happen .
what is territori cooper ?
what purpos doe it serv ?
what are the issu at stake ?
how promin should it be within region polici ?
these are the question we need to answer .
europ is divid into 27 member state and 271 region .
what futur do we want to give it ?
first , i want to look at mr pieper 's report .
we have had frequent discus on this subject .
if we want to cut co2 emiss , we must begin in the citi .
that is whi it is import .
we have alreadi discus territori cooper on sever occas .
thank you onc again for your contribut .
i am look forward to the discus .
final , i would make this point .
we therefor need some rapid new think .
we a politician ought to do the same .
approxim 73 % of europ 's total popul live in urban area .
a varieti of studi have demonstr this .
the new intermedi categori remain controversi .
they will not be fund at the expens of other region .
it is not busi a usual .
it is the instrument which hold the eu togeth at it heart .
( de ) i have to disagre with this question .
mr pieper 's report in particular strengthen their posit .
this is especi import for u at this point .
this money is not a freebi from brussel .
it is cynic propaganda .
the principl of cofinanc must be firm establish .
in realist term , it would blow the budget .
we know this to be a fact .
it is not just someth that peopl say .
we need to take a critic look at this approach .
cohes polici is a key polici for the eu .
the polici object are well known .
i am count on the intellig and effici of my fellow member .
we regret that this doe not appear in the pieper report .
we are current talk about 51 region .
then we take a look at these new challeng .
that is excel in itself .
in truth , there is one linger point in the debat .
we do not yet know which region are involv .
we do not know where it will be paid out .
we do not know what the cofinanc percentag are .
we have done that alreadi .
we shall do so .
that is a veri import point .
cohes polici lie at the heart of european polici .
it is , therefor , threaten with the loss of support .
it track record in the last 30 year ha been excel .
it demand prioriti for the futur .
first , no reduct in budgetari commit for cohes polici .
the creation of intermedi region is essenti for that .
i would like to focus these few comment on three issu .
i shall focus on transpar , on which i draft a report .
we need to send out a clear messag .
we can not have a two- or three-spe cohes polici .
the inform requir therefor need to be diffus and use .
this is a polici which enabl structur reform and progress .
that is a prioriti .
by creat it , we will preserv this budget .
i think that no one here wish to see this budget reduc .
cohes polici should also promot transpar .
therefor , eu support is necessari .
i hope that the council will take note of this .
their natur requir applic of the eu territori cooper rule .
the eu 's region polici is dog by red tape and abus .
this would be a suicid step .
border region are still face with particular challeng .
we need clear , simpl structur for interregion project .
they should be given the necessari support in this role .
i believ that it structur underpin european competit .
fellow member , smes are key to boost econom competit .
this is whi the fifth cohes report is so time .
there are three key idea .
the third idea is to reinforc object 3 .
i wish to make two request .
that is not so .
the 23 languag of the eu are what make u rich and diver .
i would like to begin with someth veri import to me .
we must use suitabl mean to tri to simplifi our busi .
condit will help u to improv the qualiti of our work .
this is the whole point of region polici .
onc more , welcom to brussel and to our parliament .
it is clear to me that such a radic chang is imposs .
this wa true 60 year ago and it is still true today .
we shall not be make concess on those posit .
the joint debat is close .
the vote will take place short .
( the sit wa suspend at 11.45 and resum at 11.50 )
written statement ( rule 149 )
whi are doubl standard be protect ?
in whose interest is it to delay reform ?
at the same time , regul need to be improv .
cohes polici is target exclus at invest .
the financi crisi ha further exacerb region differ .
europ is confront large-scal unemploy .
